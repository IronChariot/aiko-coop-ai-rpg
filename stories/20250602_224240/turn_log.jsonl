As he introduces us, I offer a polite nod to the gathered faces, my expression calm and composed. Turning to the butler—Mr. Graves, if I recall the initial report correctly—I adjust my glasses slightly, a habit when assessing a new environment. "Quite right, Inspector," I say evenly, my voice carrying a faint note of dry amusement. "The storm shows no sign of letting up; best to keep everyone settled while we attend to the matter at hand." I glance back at the group, noting their anxious demeanors, before focusing on Hale, ready to follow his lead.'}, 'player_input': None}
{'turn': 'gm', 'responses': {'partner': 'I follow Inspector Hale\'s lead, stepping further into the dimly lit foyer and closing the heavy door against the howling wind. The air inside is thick with the scent of polished wood and damp wool, a stark contrast to the storm outside. As the butler—Mr. Graves, I believe—nods curtly and gestures toward a corridor, I make a quick mental note of the gathered faces: Lord Harrington looks pale and shaken, while a woman I recognize as Ms. Lydia Thorne from the case file eyes us with guarded curiosity. "Indeed," I add softly to Hale, adjusting my glasses as I glance at the group, "a bit of separation might prevent any... premature speculation. Shall I jot down a quick list of those present while you coordinate with Mr. Graves?" My tone remains even, offering assistance without presumption, as I subtly observe the room for any initial clues.'}, 'player_input': None}
