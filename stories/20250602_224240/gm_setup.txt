## GM Setup Instructions

As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful atmosphere by controlling the pacing of clues and NPC interactions. Use the story bible as a scaffold for key beats, but allow improvisation based on player actionsâ€”e.g., if Hale focuses on a minor detail, weave it into the narrative. Track fail-states to introduce consequences, and ensure all NPCs behave consistently with their profiles. Reveal secrets gradually to build tension, and end sessions on cliffhangers if playing in parts. Remember to describe sensory details (e.g., the creak of floorboards, flickering candlelight) to immerse players in the 1930s noir setting.
