Inspector Jonathan Hale and his assistant, Evelyn Hart, pull up to the foreboding estate in their sleek black automobile. The rain beats down relentlessly, turning the gravel drive into a muddy quagmire.

The door creaks open, revealing a group of anxious faces, and Hale knows that with the weather trapping them all inside, the killer may be closer than anyone suspects.
