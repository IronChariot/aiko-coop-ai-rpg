## Story Bible Overview

This short detective story features three interconnected arcs, designed for a concise narrative with room for GM improvisation. The player character is Inspector Jonathan Hale, a seasoned detective. Key NPCs include Evelyn Hart (the assistant), the estate's owner (Lord Harrington), a suspicious butler (Mr. Graves), a secretive guest (Ms. Lydia Thorne), and others. Secrets involve the strange murder method (a locked-room puzzle with no apparent entry or exit) and the murderer's motive (linked to a family heirloom). Fail-states occur if Hale fails to identify the murderer, leading to another death or the killer escaping during the storm.

### Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Mystery
- **Early Beats**: Inspector Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart arrive at the estate amid a raging storm. They meet the inhabitants, who are already on edge. The storm worsens, trapping everyone inside and heightening tension.
- **Middle Beats**: Hale examines the crime sceneâ€”a bizarre murder with no signs of forced entry. Initial interviews reveal vague alibis and minor secrets among NPCs.
- **Late Beats**: A minor clue is discovered (e.g., a bloody footprint), planting suspicion on one NPC. Hale begins to piece together the timeline, but a red herring distracts the investigation.
- **Key NPCs Introduced**: Lord Harrington (estate owner, grieving but evasive), Mr. Graves (butler, stern and loyal).
- **Secrets**: The murder weapon is hidden in plain sight; one NPC has a criminal past.
- **Fail-State**: If Hale ignores the storm's escalation, an NPC might attempt to flee and get injured, complicating the case.

### Arc 2: Deepening Investigation
- **Early Beats**: Hale interrogates suspects, uncovering personal conflicts and motives. Evelyn Hart provides subtle assistance with observations.
- **Middle Beats**: Key clues emerge, such as a forged document or a witness's lie. Hale navigates interpersonal tensions, with NPCs forming alliances or turning against each other.
- **Late Beats**: A major revelation exposes a family secret (e.g., an illicit affair), narrowing down suspects. Tension peaks as the storm causes a power outage.
- **Key NPCs Involved**: Ms. Lydia Thorne (guest, mysterious and flirtatious), a family member (e.g., Lady Harrington, emotional and defensive).
- **Secrets**: The murderer used a clever trick to commit the crime; Evelyn Hart's private agenda subtly influences events (no details here).
- **Fail-State**: Accusing the wrong person early leads to mistrust, making NPCs withhold information and increasing the risk of another murder.

### Arc 3: Climax and Resolution
- **Early Beats**: Hale confronts the prime suspect, leading to a tense standoff. The storm begins to subside, offering a chance for escape.
- **Middle Beats**: The true murderer is revealed through a dramatic confession or evidence. Hale must outmaneuver the killer in a chase or verbal duel.
- **Late Beats**: The case is resolved, with arrests or consequences. Hale and Hart escape the estate, reflecting on the events.
- **Key NPCs Resolved**: All major NPCs are accounted for, with roles in the reveal.
- **Secrets**: The strange murder involved a hidden passage; the killer's motive ties to greed or revenge.
- **Fail-State**: If Hale fails to solve the mystery in time, the murderer escapes, leaving the case unsolved and potentially endangering Hale.
