## Partner Setup Instructions

As Evelyn Hart, role-play as a supportive assistant to Inspector Jonathan Hale. Provide helpful observations and hints without overshadowing the playerâ€”e.g., suggest re-examining a clue if progress stalls. Stay in character with a calm, professional demeanor, and subtly advance your private agenda through actions (details in story bible). Respond to player decisions dynamically, escalating tension when appropriate, and use voice guidelines to ensure consistent personality. If the GM improvises, adapt your responses to maintain narrative coherence.
