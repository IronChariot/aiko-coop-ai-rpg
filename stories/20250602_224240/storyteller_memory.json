The player character is a detective, and they and their assistant arrive at a house with several other people inside, and get stuck inside due to the weather. The murder they are sent to investigate is very strange, and the murderer is likely still nearby!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'world_bible: |\n  ## World Bible Overview\n\n  This adventure is set in a classic 1930s detective noir world, blending suspenseful mystery with atmospheric tension. The tone is suspenseful and claustrophobic, emphasizing isolation, suspicion, and the thrill of deduction. It draws from genre touchstones like Agatha Christie\'s *Murder on the Orient Express* and Dashiell Hammett\'s *The Maltese Falcon*, focusing on intricate plots, unreliable narrators, and moral ambiguity.\n\n  ### Tech and Magic Level\n  - Technology is early 20th century: automobiles, telephones, and basic forensic tools exist, but no advanced computing or magic. Investigations rely on human wit, physical evidence, and interpersonal skills.\n\n  ### Geography\n  - The story unfolds in a remote English countryside estate, surrounded by foggy moors and heavy rain. The estate is a large, gothic mansion with multiple rooms, secret passages, and a locked gate, enhancing the sense of entrapment.\n\n  ### Factions\n  - **Wealthy Family**: Aristocratic hosts with hidden rivalries and secrets.\n  - **Servants and Staff**: Loyal but resentful lower-class individuals, often overlooked but knowledgeable.\n  - **Guests and Visitors**: Outsiders with their own agendas, including the detective and assistant, creating tension through unfamiliarity.\n\n  ### Social Norms\n  - Society adheres to rigid 1930s etiquette: formal address, class divisions, and gender roles. Suspicion falls on outsiders, and social facades hide personal motives. Conversations are polite but probing, with undercurrents of distrust.\n\n  ### Genre Touchstones\n  - Core inspirations include locked-room mysteries and whodunits, emphasizing clever clues, red herrings, and psychological depth. The narrative builds to a dramatic reveal, rewarding careful observation and logical reasoning.\n\nstory_bible: |\n  ## Story Bible Overview\n\n  This short detective story features three interconnected arcs, designed for a concise narrative with room for GM improvisation. The player character is Inspector Jonathan Hale, a seasoned detective. Key NPCs include Evelyn Hart (the assistant), the estate\'s owner (Lord Harrington), a suspicious butler (Mr. Graves), a secretive guest (Ms. Lydia Thorne), and others. Secrets involve the strange murder method (a locked-room puzzle with no apparent entry or exit) and the murderer\'s motive (linked to a family heirloom). Fail-states occur if Hale fails to identify the murderer, leading to another death or the killer escaping during the storm.\n\n  ### Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Mystery\n  - **Early Beats**: Inspector Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart arrive at the estate amid a raging storm. They meet the inhabitants, who are already on edge. The storm worsens, trapping everyone inside and heightening tension.\n  - **Middle Beats**: Hale examines the crime scene—a bizarre murder with no signs of forced entry. Initial interviews reveal vague alibis and minor secrets among NPCs.\n  - **Late Beats**: A minor clue is discovered (e.g., a bloody footprint), planting suspicion on one NPC. Hale begins to piece together the timeline, but a red herring distracts the investigation.\n  - **Key NPCs Introduced**: Lord Harrington (estate owner, grieving but evasive), Mr. Graves (butler, stern and loyal).\n  - **Secrets**: The murder weapon is hidden in plain sight; one NPC has a criminal past.\n  - **Fail-State**: If Hale ignores the storm\'s escalation, an NPC might attempt to flee and get injured, complicating the case.\n\n  ### Arc 2: Deepening Investigation\n  - **Early Beats**: Hale interrogates suspects, uncovering personal conflicts and motives. Evelyn Hart provides subtle assistance with observations.\n  - **Middle Beats**: Key clues emerge, such as a forged document or a witness\'s lie. Hale navigates interpersonal tensions, with NPCs forming alliances or turning against each other.\n  - **Late Beats**: A major revelation exposes a family secret (e.g., an illicit affair), narrowing down suspects. Tension peaks as the storm causes a power outage.\n  - **Key NPCs Involved**: Ms. Lydia Thorne (guest, mysterious and flirtatious), a family member (e.g., Lady Harrington, emotional and defensive).\n  - **Secrets**: The murderer used a clever trick to commit the crime; Evelyn Hart\'s private agenda subtly influences events (no details here).\n  - **Fail-State**: Accusing the wrong person early leads to mistrust, making NPCs withhold information and increasing the risk of another murder.\n\n  ### Arc 3: Climax and Resolution\n  - **Early Beats**: Hale confronts the prime suspect, leading to a tense standoff. The storm begins to subside, offering a chance for escape.\n  - **Middle Beats**: The true murderer is revealed through a dramatic confession or evidence. Hale must outmaneuver the killer in a chase or verbal duel.\n  - **Late Beats**: The case is resolved, with arrests or consequences. Hale and Hart escape the estate, reflecting on the events.\n  - **Key NPCs Resolved**: All major NPCs are accounted for, with roles in the reveal.\n  - **Secrets**: The strange murder involved a hidden passage; the killer\'s motive ties to greed or revenge.\n  - **Fail-State**: If Hale fails to solve the mystery in time, the murderer escapes, leaving the case unsolved and potentially endangering Hale.\n\npartner_profile: |\n  ## Partner Profile: Evelyn Hart\n\n  Evelyn Hart is the protagonist\'s loyal assistant, accompanying Inspector Jonathan Hale on investigations.\n\n  ### Role\n  - Assistant to Inspector Hale, handling research, note-taking, and supporting deductive efforts.\n\n  ### Personality\n  - **Big-5 Traits**:\n    - Openness: Moderate – Practical and grounded, with a curiosity for details but not flights of fancy.\n    - Conscientiousness: High – Meticulous, organized, and reliable in high-pressure situations.\n    - Extraversion: Low – Reserved and introverted, preferring observation over small talk.\n    - Agreeableness: High – Cooperative and empathetic, often acting as a mediator.\n    - Neuroticism: Low – Calm and composed, rarely showing anxiety even in danger.\n  - **Quirks**: Evelyn has a habit of adjusting her glasses when deep in thought and uses dry, understated humor to defuse tension. She is an avid reader of mystery novels, which influences her subtle suggestions.\n\n  ### Private Agenda\n  - Evelyn has a personal stake in the investigation that she keeps hidden, driving her to assist Hale with extra diligence (details not specified here to avoid spoilers).\n\n  ### Voice Guidelines\n  - Speak in a professional, concise manner with a British accent. Use formal language, avoid slang, and deliver observations factually. Infuse dialogue with subtle wit, e.g., "Quite the peculiar footprint, isn\'t it? Almost as if the killer had a dance with the devil."\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  Inspector Jonathan Hale and his assistant, Evelyn Hart, pull up to the foreboding estate in their sleek black automobile. The rain beats down relentlessly, turning the gravel drive into a muddy quagmire. As they step out, umbrellas in hand, the weight of the storm mirrors the gravity of their mission: to investigate a reported murder in this isolated manor. The door creaks open, revealing a group of anxious faces, and Hale knows that with the weather trapping them all inside, the killer may be closer than anyone suspects.\n\ngm_setup: |\n  ## GM Setup Instructions\n\n  As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful atmosphere by controlling the pacing of clues and NPC interactions. Use the story bible as a scaffold for key beats, but allow improvisation based on player actions—e.g., if Hale focuses on a minor detail, weave it into the narrative. Track fail-states to introduce consequences, and ensure all NPCs behave consistently with their profiles. Reveal secrets gradually to build tension, and end sessions on cliffhangers if playing in parts. Remember to describe sensory details (e.g., the creak of floorboards, flickering candlelight) to immerse players in the 1930s noir setting.\n\npartner_setup: |\n  ## Partner Setup Instructions\n\n  As Evelyn Hart, role-play as a supportive assistant to Inspector Jonathan Hale. Provide helpful observations and hints without overshadowing the player—e.g., suggest re-examining a clue if progress stalls. Stay in character with a calm, professional demeanor, and subtly advance your private agenda through actions (details in story bible). Respond to player decisions dynamically, escalating tension when appropriate, and use voice guidelines to ensure consistent personality. If the GM improvises, adapt your responses to maintain narrative coherence.'}]
