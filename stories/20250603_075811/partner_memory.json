No magic; all elements are grounded in realism.\n\n#### Geography\n- The primary setting is a remote, isolated mansion in a rural area, surrounded by dense woods and cut off by severe weather.

Lightning flashes, illuminating the dimly lit foyer where a group of anxious faces turn to greet them. Hale, a seasoned investigator with a sharp eye for detail, scans the room, noting the tension in the air. The storm outside howls, slamming the door shut behind them and trapping everyone inside. A body lies covered in the parlor, the victim of a bizarre murder that defies easy explanation. As the group huddles together, Hale knows the killer is among them, waiting for their next move.\n- Player: Detective Hale turns to the small crowd as he takes off his dripping hat. He nods to them and says, "Detective Jon Hale. This is my assistant, Miss Evelyn Hart." He hesitates a moment. "Perhaps there is a sitting room where you good people could wait while we, um, inspect the scene of the crime?"\n\nCurrent situation: The group in the foyer exchanges uneasy glances, the flickering candlelight casting shadows that deepen the tension. The victim\'s spouse, a pale woman with trembling hands, nods hesitantly and murmurs, "Yes, of course, Detective. The sitting room is just down the hall—through there." She gestures vaguely, her voice cracking with feigned composure. The house servant, a stoic figure in a worn uniform, steps forward smoothly, saying, "I\'ll show you the way, sir, miss. Best to keep everyone out of the parlor for now." Evelyn Hart adjusts her glasses with a subtle nod, her dry humor surfacing as she adds under her breath, "At least it\'ll give us a moment to dry off before diving into the mess." As the suspects shuffle away, the storm\'s fury rattles the windows, leaving Hale and Hart a brief respite to approach the crime scene undisturbed.\nPlayer\'s action: Detective Hale turns to the small crowd as he takes off his dripping hat.
