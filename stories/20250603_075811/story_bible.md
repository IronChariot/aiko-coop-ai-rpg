### Story Bible Overview

This detective story is structured into three arcs, each with early, middle, and late beats. The narrative focuses on investigating a strange murder in a confined space, with increasing tension and revelations. Key NPCs include suspects in the house, and secrets are tied to the murder's motive and perpetrator. Fail-states occur if the player makes critical errors, leading to dire consequences.

#### Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Investigation
- **Early Beats**: Detective Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart arrive at the mansion amid a storm, meet the group of suspects, and examine the crime scene. They discover the victim's body and initial clues, such as a cryptic note or unusual wound.
- **Middle Beats**: Hale interrogates key suspects, uncovers minor inconsistencies in alibis, and finds a first red herring, like a stolen item.
- **Late Beats**: A secret is revealed—e.g., the victim had a hidden affair—escalating suspicion. Key NPC: The victim's spouse, who appears grief-stricken but evasive.
- **Key NPCs**: 
  - Victim's Spouse: Nervous and defensive, with a hidden agenda.

- **Secrets**: The murder weapon is concealed in an unexpected place; the victim was involved in blackmail.
