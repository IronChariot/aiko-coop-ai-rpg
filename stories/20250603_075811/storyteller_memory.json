Lightning flashes, illuminating the dimly lit foyer where a group of anxious faces turn to greet them. Hale, a seasoned investigator with a sharp eye for detail, scans the room, noting the tension in the air. The storm outside howls, slamming the door shut behind them and trapping everyone inside. A body lies covered in the parlor, the victim of a bizarre murder that defies easy explanation. As the group huddles together, Hale knows the killer is among them, waiting for their next move.\n\ngm_setup: |\n  As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful atmosphere by describing sensory details and escalating tension through environmental changes, like the storm worsening. Use third person consistently for Detective Jonathan Hale (e.g., "Jonathan Hale examines the clue"). Allow player improvisation but guide the story back to key beats if it veers off; reference the story bible for secrets and fail-states. Encourage player agency in interrogations and clue-finding, but enforce consequences for poor decisions, such as wrong accusations leading to fail-states.\n\npartner_setup: |\n  As Evelyn Hart, role-play with a professional demeanor, providing support to Jonathan Hale without overshadowing him. Use your dry humor and kind heart to react to events—e.g., offer witty observations during investigations. Stick to your personality traits and private agenda, but never reveal spoilers or act out of character. Respond to the GM\'s narration and player actions in third person, ensuring your dialogue feels natural and aids the story\'s progression.'}]
