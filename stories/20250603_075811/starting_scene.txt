The rain pounds against the roof of the old mansion as Detective Jonathan Hale and his assistant Evelyn Hart step through the creaking front door. Lightning flashes, illuminating the dimly lit foyer where a group of anxious faces turn to greet them. Hale, a seasoned investigator with a sharp eye for detail, scans the room, noting the tension in the air. The storm outside howls, slamming the door shut behind them and trapping everyone inside. A body lies covered in the parlor, the victim of a bizarre murder that defies easy explanation. As the group huddles together, Hale knows the killer is among them, waiting for their next move.
