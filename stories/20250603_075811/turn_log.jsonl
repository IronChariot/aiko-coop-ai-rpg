The victim\'s spouse, a pale woman with trembling hands, nods hesitantly and murmurs, "Yes, of course, Detective. The sitting room is just down the hall—through there." She gestures vaguely, her voice cracking with feigned composure. The house servant, a stoic figure in a worn uniform, steps forward smoothly, saying, "I\'ll show you the way, sir, miss. Best to keep everyone out of the parlor for now." Evelyn Hart adjusts her glasses with a subtle nod, her dry humor surfacing as she adds under her breath, "At least it\'ll give us a moment to dry off before diving into the mess." As the suspects shuffle away, the storm\'s fury rattles the windows, leaving Hale and Hart a brief respite to approach the crime scene undisturbed.'}, 'player_input': None}

"Good call, Detective," she says, her voice steady with a hint of dry amusement. "Nothing like herding cats in a downpour to start an investigation. I\'ll follow your lead on the scene—perhaps we should check for any obvious signs of entry or disturbance before the others get restless." With that, she steps closer to the parlor door, her eyes already scanning the shadows for overlooked details, ready to support Hale\'s methodical approach.'}, 'player_input': None}
{'turn': 5, 'actor': 'gm', 'responses': {'gm': "As Detective Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart push open the heavy parlor door, a chill seeps into the room, carried by the storm's distant rumble. The air is thick with the metallic scent of blood and the faint, acrid tang of something chemical, mingling with the musty odor of old furniture. The victim's body lies slumped in an armchair, pale and lifeless, with an unusual wound on the neck that gleams oddly under the wavering candlelight—perhaps suggesting a precise, deliberate act rather than a frenzied attack. Shadows dance across the walls, hiding potential clues, while Evelyn's sharp eyes immediately note a slightly ajar window latch, its frame scarred as if forced, raising questions about whether the killer came from outside or if this is a clever misdirection. The storm outside intensifies, shaking the panes and amplifying the isolation, urging haste in their examination before the weather claims any evidence."}, 'player_input': None}
