### World Bible

#### Tone
- Suspenseful and mysterious, emphasizing deduction, interpersonal tension, and psychological depth. The atmosphere is claustrophobic and eerie, with a focus on human flaws and secrets.

#### Tech/Magic Level
- Modern-day technology with no magic. Includes standard forensic tools like fingerprint kits, cameras, and communication devices, but relies on human wit and observation over high-tech gadgets.

#### Geography
- Set in a remote English countryside, featuring an isolated, large manor house surrounded by foggy moors and dense woods. The stormy weather traps everyone inside, heightening isolation and danger.

#### Factions
- **Household Suspects**: A small group of individuals with conflicting motives, including family members, servants, and guests, all potential allies or antagonists in the investigation.
- **Law Enforcement**: Minimal external support, represented by Detective Jonathan Hale and his assistant, with possible references to distant police stations that are unreachable due to the weather.

#### Social Norms
- Adhere to polite, upper-class British etiquette on the surface, but underlying tensions reveal hypocrisy, hidden resentments, and class disparities. Lies and deceptions are common, making trust scarce.

#### Genre Touchstones
- Inspired by Agatha Christie's whodunits (e.g., "And Then There Were None"), with elements of classic detective fiction like Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, focusing on clever clues, red herrings, and moral ambiguity.
