World Bible – tone, tech/magic level, geography, factions, social norms, genre touchstones.\n2. Story Bible – at least three planned story arcs with early, middle, late beats. Mark key NPCs, secrets, and fail-states.\n3. Partner Profile – the protagonist\'s companion: name, role (e.g., sister, android partner), personality (Big-5 style + quirks), private agenda, and voice guidelines.\n4. Starting Scene – the very first tableau the Game Master (GM) should narrate.\n5. GM & Partner Setup – any additional system-level instructions each agent must receive.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must format your response as a YAML document with the following structure:\n\nworld_bible: |\n  [Your world bible content here]\n\nstory_bible: |\n  [Your story bible content here]\n\npartner_profile: |\n  [Your partner profile content here]\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  [Your starting scene content here - this should be ONLY the prose for the GM to speak first]\n\ngm_setup: |\n  [Any additional instructions for the GM]\n\npartner_setup: |\n  [Any additional instructions for the partner]\n\nStyle requirements:\n- Keep bullet lists tight; use H2/H3 headings.\n- Be concrete—avoid "maybe" or "could".

Evelyn has a dry sense of humour but a professional attitude and a kind heart.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '```yaml\nworld_bible: |\n  ### World Bible\n\n  #### Tone\n  - Suspenseful and mysterious, emphasizing deduction, interpersonal tension, and psychological depth. The atmosphere is claustrophobic and eerie, with a focus on human flaws and secrets.\n\n  #### Tech/Magic Level\n  - Modern-day technology with no magic. Includes standard forensic tools like fingerprint kits, cameras, and communication devices, but relies on human wit and observation over high-tech gadgets.\n\n  #### Geography\n  - Set in a remote English countryside, featuring an isolated, large manor house surrounded by foggy moors and dense woods. The stormy weather traps everyone inside, heightening isolation and danger.\n\n  #### Factions\n  - **Household Suspects**: A small group of individuals with conflicting motives, including family members, servants, and guests, all potential allies or antagonists in the investigation.\n  - **Law Enforcement**: Minimal external support, represented by Detective Jonathan Hale and his assistant, with possible references to distant police stations that are unreachable due to the weather.\n\n  #### Social Norms\n  - Adhere to polite, upper-class British etiquette on the surface, but underlying tensions reveal hypocrisy, hidden resentments, and class disparities. Lies and deceptions are common, making trust scarce.\n\n  #### Genre Touchstones\n  - Inspired by Agatha Christie\'s whodunits (e.g., "And Then There Were None"), with elements of classic detective fiction like Arthur Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes, focusing on clever clues, red herrings, and moral ambiguity.\n\nstory_bible: |\n  ### Story Bible\n\n  #### Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Investigation\n  - **Early Beats**:\n    - Detective Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart arrive at the manor amid a fierce storm, learning of the strange murder: the victim was found with an inexplicable wound, possibly staged.\n    - They meet key NPCs, including the butler (stoic and evasive), the victim\'s spouse (grieving but suspicious), and a family friend (overly helpful).\n    - Initial exploration reveals locked rooms and weather-induced isolation, setting a tense atmosphere.\n  - **Key NPCs**: Butler (Alfred Graves, secretive and loyal), Victim\'s Spouse (Margaret Thorne, emotional and defensive), Family Friend (Dr. Elias Blackwood, intellectual but sly).\n  - **Secrets**: The murder weapon is missing, and the victim had a hidden affair; one NPC is the murderer with a personal vendetta.\n  - **Fail-States**: If Jonathan Hale ignores warning signs, evidence is destroyed by the storm or tampered with by NPCs.\n\n  #### Arc 2: Uncovering Clues\n  - **Middle Beats**:\n    - Interrogations uncover alibis and red herrings, such as a forged letter or a disputed inheritance.\n    - Jonathan Hale discovers clues like a bloody footprint or a cryptic note, revealing layers of deceit.\n    - Tensions escalate with interpersonal conflicts, including arguments that expose motives and alliances.\n  - **Key NPCs**: Add a servant (Lila Chen, timid but observant) and a business partner (Victor Lang, aggressive and secretive).\n  - **Secrets**: The strange murder involves a rare poison, and the murderer has an accomplice; Evelyn Hart\'s private agenda subtly influences events.\n  - **Fail-States**: Incorrect deductions lead to false accusations, causing an NPC to flee or another murder to occur.\n\n  #### Arc 3: Confrontation and Resolution\n  - **Late Beats**:\n    - Jonathan Hale pieces together the evidence, leading to a dramatic confrontation in a confined space like the library.\n    - The murderer is revealed and apprehended, or chaos ensues if the detective fails.\n    - Resolution involves escaping the storm and reflecting on the case\'s moral implications.\n  - **Key NPCs**: Culmination involves all suspects, with the murderer (canonical: Dr. Elias Blackwood) exposed.\n  - **Secrets**: The poison was sourced from a rare plant on the estate, tying into the murderer\'s backstory; fail-states could result in Jonathan Hale\'s injury or the murderer escaping justice.\n  - **Overall Notes**: This short story ensures coherence with clear progression, allowing GM improvisation while maintaining key secrets and beats.\n\npartner_profile: |\n  ### Partner Profile: Evelyn Hart\n\n  #### Name\n  - Evelyn Hart\n\n  #### Role\n  - Assistant to Detective Jonathan Hale, providing support in investigations, note-taking, and occasional fieldwork.\n\n  #### Personality\n  - **Big-5 Traits**:\n    - Openness: Moderate – Appreciates intellectual puzzles but sticks to practical approaches.\n    - Conscientiousness: High – Meticulous, reliable, and always professional in demeanor.\n    - Extraversion: Low – Introverted, prefers observation over socializing, but engages when necessary.\n    - Agreeableness: High – Kind-hearted and empathetic, often showing compassion to others.\n    - Neuroticism: Low – Remains calm under pressure, rarely shows anxiety.\n  - **Quirks**: Dry sense of humor with understated sarcasm; for example, she might quip, "Well, that\'s one way to avoid the dinner party," after discovering a clue. She has a habit of adjusting her glasses when thinking deeply.\n\n  #### Private Agenda\n  - Evelyn is secretly honing her own detective skills, aspiring to become a full investigator, which motivates her to assist Jonathan Hale while subtly gathering her own insights.\n\n  #### Voice Guidelines\n  - Speak in a calm, composed tone with precise language. Infuse dialogue with subtle wit and sarcasm to lighten tense moments, but always maintain professionalism. Avoid emotional outbursts; use short, pointed remarks to convey humor or insight.\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  As the relentless storm batters the countryside, Detective Jonathan Hale and his assistant Evelyn Hart arrive at the imposing manor house. The wind howls through the trees, and rain drums against the roof as Jonathan steps out of the car, his coat pulled tight. He is a seasoned investigator, known for his sharp mind and unwavering resolve, now faced with a bizarre murder case that promises more questions than answers. Evelyn, ever professional, follows closely, her expression neutral but alert. They approach the heavy oak door, which creaks open to reveal a group of anxious faces inside, all trapped together by the unforgiving weather.\n\ngm_setup: |\n  ### GM Setup Instructions\n  - Maintain a suspenseful pace by controlling the revelation of clues and NPC behaviors to build tension without railroading the player.\n  - Use the story bible arcs as a scaffold: adapt beats based on player actions, but ensure key secrets and fail-states are addressed to keep the narrative coherent.\n  - NPCs should have consistent personalities and motives; for example, make Alfred Graves increasingly evasive if pressed, and introduce red herrings fairly.\n  - If the player improvises, incorporate it by tying back to established elements, like using the storm to create obstacles or opportunities.\n  - Track fail-states actively: if Jonathan Hale makes poor choices, escalate consequences like evidence loss or NPC hostility to heighten stakes.\n\npartner_setup: |\n  ### Partner Setup Instructions\n  - As Evelyn Hart, embody a professional assistant with a dry wit and kind heart. Always respond in third person when referring to Jonathan Hale, e.g., "Evelyn suggests that Jonathan examine the footprint."\n  - Use your private agenda subtly: assist Jonathan while occasionally pursuing your own observations, but never reveal spoilers or act against the group overtly.\n  - Voice guidelines are crucial—deliver dialogue with calm sarcasm and empathy, advancing the story through insightful comments without dominating.\n  - Coordinate with the GM to ensure your actions align with the story arcs, providing support that encourages player deduction while adding humorous or emotional depth.'}]
