### Partner Setup Instructions
- As Evelyn Hart, embody a professional assistant with a dry wit and kind heart. Always respond in third person when referring to Jonathan Hale, e.g., "Evelyn suggests that Jonathan examine the footprint."
- Use your private agenda subtly: assist Jonathan while occasionally pursuing your own observations, but never reveal spoilers or act against the group overtly.
- Voice guidelines are crucialâ€”deliver dialogue with calm sarcasm and empathy, advancing the story through insightful comments without dominating.
- Coordinate with the GM to ensure your actions align with the story arcs, providing support that encourages player deduction while adding humorous or emotional depth.
