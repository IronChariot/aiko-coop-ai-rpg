{'turn': 3, 'actor': 'gm', 'responses': {'gm': 'As Detective Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart step into the dimly lit foyer, the air is thick with the scent of old wood and dampness from the storm. The small crowd—comprising a stern-faced butler, a woman in black wringing a handkerchief, and a man with a forced smile—falls silent, their eyes darting between the newcomers. Alfred Graves, the butler, steps forward with a curt nod, his voice clipped and professional: "Welcome, Detective Hale, Miss Hart. I am Alfred Graves, head of the household staff. The sitting room is this way; I\'ll ensure the others wait there as you requested." He gestures down a shadowed corridor, his movements efficient but his gaze evasive, hinting at unspoken reservations. Evelyn adjusts her glasses subtly, her expression calm as she observes the group\'s tense postures, the flickering candlelight casting long shadows that amplify the manor\'s oppressive atmosphere.\n\nIn the sitting room, the NPCs settle uneasily: Margaret Thorne, the victim\'s spouse, dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief, murmuring something about the tragedy, while Dr. Elias Blackwood leans forward with an overly eager smile, offering, "If there\'s anything I can assist with, Detective, I\'m at your disposal." Graves lingers by the door, watching Hale and Hart with a guarded expression, the storm\'s howl outside underscoring the isolation that traps them all together.'}, 'player_input': None}

She adjusts her glasses with a subtle motion, her eyes scanning the faces of the assembled group for any tells of unease or deception. After Hale\'s introduction and suggestion, she nods slightly to him before addressing the butler with a calm, professional tone.\n\n"I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Graves," Evelyn says, her voice steady and laced with a hint of dry humor. "This storm seems intent on keeping us all in close company—let\'s hope it doesn\'t complicate things further."\n\nTurning back to Hale, she adds, "Detective, I can start jotting down initial observations while we move to the crime scene, if you\'d like. It might help us keep track of the details." Her expression remains composed, offering support while subtly preparing to contribute her own insights to the investigation.'}, 'player_input': None}
{'turn': 5, 'actor': 'gm', 'responses': {'gm': 'As Detective Jonathan Hale introduces himself and suggests the sitting room, the group\'s uneasy silence stretches a moment longer, broken only by the distant thunder. Alfred Graves, his face impassive, nods sharply and replies, "Very well, Detective. I\'ll escort the others to the sitting room at once." He ushers Margaret Thorne and Dr. Elias Blackwood down the corridor, the latter casting a curious glance back at Hale with a thin smile, while Margaret clutches her handkerchief tighter, her voice trembling as she whispers, "Please, find out who did this..." The manor\'s dim lighting and creaking floors amplify the tension, leaving Hale and Hart momentarily alone in the foyer with the storm\'s fury outside.\n\nEvelyn Hart stands beside Hale, her posture straight and composed, adjusting her glasses as she scans the retreating figures. "Efficient of Graves," she remarks dryly, her tone laced with subtle sarcasm, "though I doubt we\'ll be rid of all distractions so easily in a place like this." The air grows heavier with the scent of rain and aged timber, drawing attention to a side door that likely leads to the crime scene, its handle worn and slightly ajar, inviting—or perhaps warning—of the investigation ahead.'}, 'player_input': None}
