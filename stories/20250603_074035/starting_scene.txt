As the relentless storm batters the countryside, Detective Jonathan Hale and his assistant Evelyn Hart arrive at the imposing manor house. The wind howls through the trees, and rain drums against the roof as Jonathan steps out of the car, his coat pulled tight. He is a seasoned investigator, known for his sharp mind and unwavering resolve, now faced with a bizarre murder case that promises more questions than answers. Evelyn, ever professional, follows closely, her expression neutral but alert. They approach the heavy oak door, which creaks open to reveal a group of anxious faces inside, all trapped together by the unforgiving weather.
