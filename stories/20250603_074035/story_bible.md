### Story Bible

#### Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Investigation
- **Early Beats**:
  - Detective Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart arrive at the manor amid a fierce storm, learning of the strange murder: the victim was found with an inexplicable wound, possibly staged.
  - They meet key NPCs, including the butler (stoic and evasive), the victim's spouse (grieving but suspicious), and a family friend (overly helpful).
  - Initial exploration reveals locked rooms and weather-induced isolation, setting a tense atmosphere.
- **Key NPCs**: Butler (Alfred Graves, secretive and loyal), Victim's Spouse (Margaret Thorne, emotional and defensive), Family Friend (Dr. Elias Blackwood, intellectual but sly).
- **Secrets**: The murder weapon is missing, and the victim had a hidden affair; one NPC is the murderer with a personal vendetta.
- **Fail-States**: If Jonathan Hale ignores warning signs, evidence is destroyed by the storm or tampered with by NPCs.

#### Arc 2: Uncovering Clues
- **Middle Beats**:
  - Interrogations uncover alibis and red herrings, such as a forged letter or a disputed inheritance.
  - Jonathan Hale discovers clues like a bloody footprint or a cryptic note, revealing layers of deceit.
  - Tensions escalate with interpersonal conflicts, including arguments that expose motives and alliances.
- **Key NPCs**: Add a servant (Lila Chen, timid but observant) and a business partner (Victor Lang, aggressive and secretive).
- **Secrets**: The strange murder involves a rare poison, and the murderer has an accomplice; Evelyn Hart's private agenda subtly influences events.
- **Fail-States**: Incorrect deductions lead to false accusations, causing an NPC to flee or another murder to occur.

#### Arc 3: Confrontation and Resolution
- **Late Beats**:
  - Jonathan Hale pieces together the evidence, leading to a dramatic confrontation in a confined space like the library.
  - The murderer is revealed and apprehended, or chaos ensues if the detective fails.
  - Resolution involves escaping the storm and reflecting on the case's moral implications.
- **Key NPCs**: Culmination involves all suspects, with the murderer (canonical: Dr. Elias Blackwood) exposed.
- **Secrets**: The poison was sourced from a rare plant on the estate, tying into the murderer's backstory; fail-states could result in Jonathan Hale's injury or the murderer escaping justice.
- **Overall Notes**: This short story ensures coherence with clear progression, allowing GM improvisation while maintaining key secrets and beats.
