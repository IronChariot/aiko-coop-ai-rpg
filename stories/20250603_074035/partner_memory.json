The wind howls through the trees, and rain drums against the roof as Jonathan steps out of the car, his coat pulled tight. He is a seasoned investigator, known for his sharp mind and unwavering resolve, now faced with a bizarre murder case that promises more questions than answers. Evelyn, ever professional, follows closely, her expression neutral but alert. They approach the heavy oak door, which creaks open to reveal a group of anxious faces inside, all trapped together by the unforgiving weather.\n- Player: Detective Hale steps inside, holding the door open for Evelyn, before turning to the small crowd as he takes off his dripping hat. He nods to them and says, "Detective Jon Hale. This is my assistant, Miss Evelyn Hart." He hesitates a moment. "Perhaps there is a sitting room where you good people could wait while we, um, inspect the scene of the crime?"\n\nCurrent situation: As Detective Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart step into the dimly lit foyer, the air is thick with the scent of old wood and dampness from the storm. The small crowd—comprising a stern-faced butler, a woman in black wringing a handkerchief, and a man with a forced smile—falls silent, their eyes darting between the newcomers. Alfred Graves, the butler, steps forward with a curt nod, his voice clipped and professional: "Welcome, Detective Hale, Miss Hart. I am Alfred Graves, head of the household staff. The sitting room is this way; I\'ll ensure the others wait there as you requested." He gestures down a shadowed corridor, his movements efficient but his gaze evasive, hinting at unspoken reservations. Evelyn adjusts her glasses subtly, her expression calm as she observes the group\'s tense postures, the flickering candlelight casting long shadows that amplify the manor\'s oppressive atmosphere.\n\nIn the sitting room, the NPCs settle uneasily: Margaret Thorne, the victim\'s spouse, dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief, murmuring something about the tragedy, while Dr. Elias Blackwood leans forward with an overly eager smile, offering, "If there\'s anything I can assist with, Detective, I\'m at your disposal." Graves lingers by the door, watching Hale and Hart with a guarded expression, the storm\'s howl outside underscoring the isolation that traps them all together.\nPlayer\'s action: Detective Hale steps inside, holding the door open for Evelyn, before turning to the small crowd as he takes off his dripping hat.
