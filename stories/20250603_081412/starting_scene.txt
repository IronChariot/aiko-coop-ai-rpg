The wind howls fiercely outside, battering the windows of the grand, isolated mansion known as Blackwood Estate. Detective Jonathan Hale, a seasoned investigator with a sharp mind and unyielding determination, steps out of the car with his assistant, Evelyn Hart. The storm has already cut off all roads, trapping them here with the other inhabitants. As Jonathan approaches the heavy oak door, it creaks open to reveal a group of anxious facesâ€”guests and staff huddled in the dimly lit foyer. They have summoned him for a reason: a murder has occurred, and its strangeness hints at something far more sinister. Jonathan Hale, ever the professional, readies himself to unravel the mystery, but the night is young, and danger lurks in every shadow.
