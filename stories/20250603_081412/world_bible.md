# World Bible for "Stormbound Mystery"

## Tone
- Suspenseful and atmospheric, building tension through interpersonal dynamics and unexpected twists.
- Intriguing psychological depth, focusing on human motives, lies, and secrets in a confined space.

## Tech/Magic Level
- Early 20th century technology (1920s era), including telephones, automobiles, and basic forensics tools, but no advanced tech or magicâ€”rely on human ingenuity and deduction.

## Geography
- Set in a remote English countryside mansion, isolated by a fierce storm, with dense fog and winding roads cutting off external access.
- The mansion features multiple rooms (library, dining hall, bedrooms) for exploration and clue discovery.

## Factions
- **Household Residents**: Includes the wealthy host family and their servants, with underlying class tensions and hidden rivalries.
- **Guests**: A mix of acquaintances and strangers invited to the house, each with potential motives and secrets.
- **Investigators**: Detective Jonathan Hale and his assistant Evelyn Hart, representing law enforcement and bringing an objective outsider perspective.

## Social Norms
- Rigid class distinctions, with formal address and etiquette; suspicion arises from social facades and unspoken resentments.
- Emphasis on propriety and restraint, but the storm-induced isolation breaks down social barriers, revealing raw emotions and conflicts.

## Genre Touchstones
- Inspired by Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None" for confined-space mysteries and red herrings.
- Draws from Sherlock Holmes stories for deductive reasoning and character-driven intrigue.
