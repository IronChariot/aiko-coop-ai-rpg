Detective Jonathan Hale, a seasoned investigator with a sharp mind and unyielding determination, steps out of the car with his assistant, Evelyn Hart. The storm has already cut off all roads, trapping them here with the other inhabitants. As Jonathan approaches the heavy oak door, it creaks open to reveal a group of anxious faces—guests and staff huddled in the dimly lit foyer. They have summoned him for a reason: a murder has occurred, and its strangeness hints at something far more sinister. Jonathan Hale, ever the professional, readies himself to unravel the mystery, but the night is young, and danger lurks in every shadow.\n- Player: Detective Hale steps inside, holding the door open for Evelyn, before turning to the small crowd as he takes off his dripping hat. He nods to them and says, "Detective Jon Hale. This is my assistant, Miss Evelyn Hart." He hesitates a moment. "Perhaps there is a sitting room where you good people could wait while we, um, inspect the scene of the crime?"\n- GM: The foyer of Blackwood Estate, with its high ceilings and flickering gas lamps, echoes with the relentless drumming of rain against the windows. As Detective Hale and his assistant enter, the assembled group—a mix of wide-eyed guests and stoic servants—falls silent, their faces a tapestry of fear and curiosity. Lord Harrington, a tall man with a stern countenance and a neatly trimmed mustache, steps forward from the crowd, his voice cutting through the tension with practiced authority. "Welcome, Detective Hale, and Miss Hart," he says, nodding curtly. "Indeed, the sitting room is just down the hall; my staff will escort the others there. I\'ll show you to the crime scene myself—follow me, if you please." With that, he turns sharply, leading the way deeper into the mansion, where shadows dance ominously in the storm-dimmed light.\nWhat do you do or say?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Evelyn Hart moves gracefully beside Detective Hale, her coat still glistening with raindrops from the stormy night. She adjusts her glasses with a quick, habitual motion, her eyes scanning the dimly lit corridor as they follow Lord Harrington. "Quite the atmospheric setting for an investigation," she remarks dryly, her voice carrying a subtle edge of humor to cut through the tension. "Lead on, Lord Harrington; we\'re eager to see what awaits us."'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Here\'s what happened since your last turn:\n- GM: Lord Harrington pauses mid-stride in the narrow corridor, his back stiffening slightly at Evelyn\'s remark, though his aristocratic poise prevents any overt reaction. He glances over his shoulder with a thin smile that doesn\'t quite reach his eyes, his voice laced with restrained annoyance. "Ah, yes, the weather does add a certain... drama to proceedings, doesn\'t it? Rest assured, the scene awaits us in the library— untouched since the unfortunate event." As they proceed, the air grows heavier with the scent of old books and damp stone, the storm\'s fury rattling the windowpanes, casting erratic shadows that seem to whisper secrets of their own.\n- Player: The detective follows Lord Harrington as they finally reach the library, staying silent and taking note of his surroundings.\n- GM: The group arrives at the library door, a heavy wooden barrier adorned with intricate carvings, which Lord Harrington pushes open with a creak that seems to echo the storm\'s rage. Inside, the air is thick with the musty scent of aged leather-bound books and a faint, metallic tang that hints at something more sinister. The room is cast in a gloomy pallor by a single desk lamp, illuminating a scene frozen in time: a figure slumped over a reading chair, covered by a sheet, with faint bloodstains seeping through. Scattered papers and a toppled inkwell suggest a struggle, while the locked French doors leading to the garden stand as an enigma, their keys missing, amplifying the impossibility of the crime.\n\nLord Harrington clears his throat, his posture rigid as he gestures toward the body, his voice dropping to a grave tone. "Here we are, Detective. The victim—our dear guest, Mr. Reginald Blackwood—was found like this early this morning. Note the wound; it\'s... unnatural, to say the least. I\'ll leave you to your examination, but do call if you need anything—though I must warn you, the storm has us all on edge." He steps back, folding his arms, his eyes narrowing as he watches Hale\'s silent scrutiny, a mix of impatience and guarded curiosity playing across his features.\nWhat do you do or say?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Evelyn Hart steps forward cautiously, her eyes narrowing as she surveys the chaotic scene in the library. She adjusts her glasses with a deliberate motion, the gesture steadying her focus amidst the unsettling atmosphere. "What a charming tableau," she quips dryly, her tone laced with understated sarcasm to ease the weight of the moment. "Locked doors and missing keys—almost as if the culprit had a flair for the dramatic. Shall I start noting down the details while you examine the body, Detective?" Her voice remains professional, but a subtle kindness edges her words, offering support without overshadowing his lead.'}]
