Evelyn has a dry sense of humour but a professional attitude and a kind heart.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'world_bible: |\n  # World Bible for "Stormbound Mystery"\n\n  ## Tone\n  - Suspenseful and atmospheric, building tension through interpersonal dynamics and unexpected twists.\n  - Intriguing psychological depth, focusing on human motives, lies, and secrets in a confined space.\n\n  ## Tech/Magic Level\n  - Early 20th century technology (1920s era), including telephones, automobiles, and basic forensics tools, but no advanced tech or magic—rely on human ingenuity and deduction.\n\n  ## Geography\n  - Set in a remote English countryside mansion, isolated by a fierce storm, with dense fog and winding roads cutting off external access.\n  - The mansion features multiple rooms (library, dining hall, bedrooms) for exploration and clue discovery.\n\n  ## Factions\n  - **Household Residents**: Includes the wealthy host family and their servants, with underlying class tensions and hidden rivalries.\n  - **Guests**: A mix of acquaintances and strangers invited to the house, each with potential motives and secrets.\n  - **Investigators**: Detective Jonathan Hale and his assistant Evelyn Hart, representing law enforcement and bringing an objective outsider perspective.\n\n  ## Social Norms\n  - Rigid class distinctions, with formal address and etiquette; suspicion arises from social facades and unspoken resentments.\n  - Emphasis on propriety and restraint, but the storm-induced isolation breaks down social barriers, revealing raw emotions and conflicts.\n\n  ## Genre Touchstones\n  - Inspired by Agatha Christie\'s "And Then There Were None" for confined-space mysteries and red herrings.\n  - Draws from Sherlock Holmes stories for deductive reasoning and character-driven intrigue.\n\nstory_bible: |\n  # Story Bible for "Stormbound Mystery"\n\n  ## Arc 1: The Arrival and Initial Shock\n  - **Early Beats**: Detective Jonathan Hale and Evelyn Hart arrive at the mansion amid a raging storm. They meet the host, other guests, and staff, and learn of the bizarre murder: a victim found with an impossible wound, suggesting foul play. Initial exploration reveals locked doors and a sealed-off crime scene.\n  - **Middle Beats**: Jonathan begins interviewing suspects, uncovering basic alibis and minor clues, such as a missing key or a cryptic note. Tensions rise as the storm worsens, trapping everyone inside.\n  - **Late Beats**: A red herring emerges, like a false accusation or a discovered secret that misdirects the investigation. Key NPC introduced: The host, Lord Harrington, a reclusive aristocrat with a shady past.\n  - **Secrets**: The murder weapon is hidden in plain sight; one suspect has a concealed criminal history.\n  - **Fail-State**: If Jonathan ignores a key clue, a secondary character is harmed, escalating danger.\n\n  ## Arc 2: Unraveling Deceptions\n  - **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn find contradictory statements from NPCs, leading to conflicts among the trapped individuals. A new clue, like a bloodstained glove, points to multiple possibilities.\n  - **Middle Beats**: Deeper investigation reveals personal vendettas and hidden relationships. Evelyn provides subtle insights, but a twist occurs when another "accident" happens, implying the murderer is active.\n  - **Late Beats**: Jonathan narrows down suspects, but a betrayal or alliance shift complicates matters. Key NPC introduced: A nervous guest, Miss Lydia Thorne, who knows too much.\n  - **Secrets**: The murderer has an alibi that crumbles under scrutiny; a family heirloom is central to the motive.\n  - **Fail-State**: Accusing the wrong person early leads to their "escape" or death, making resolution harder.\n\n  ## Arc 3: Climax and Revelation\n  - **Early Beats**: Jonathan assembles everyone for a confrontation, presenting evidence and accusations. Evelyn supports by corroborating details.\n  - **Middle Beats**: Suspects defend themselves, leading to revelations and emotional outbursts. The murderer attempts to shift blame or eliminate Jonathan.\n  - **Late Beats**: The true killer is unmasked through logical deduction, with a final chase or standoff in the storm-lashed mansion.\n  - **Secrets**: Murderer is [REDACTED for spoiler control], motivated by revenge or greed; a hidden passage in the mansion plays a key role.\n  - **Fail-State**: If Jonathan fails to gather sufficient evidence, the murderer escapes during the storm, ending in an unresolved mystery.\n\n  ### Key NPCs\n  - **Lord Harrington**: The host, arrogant and secretive, with a possible criminal tie.\n  - **Miss Lydia Thorne**: A guest, anxious and observant, hiding a personal connection to the victim.\n  - **Other Suspects**: Include a butler with a grudge, a family member with inheritance motives, and a mysterious visitor—each with distinct personalities and alibis.\n\npartner_profile: |\n  # Partner Profile: Evelyn Hart\n\n  ## Name\n  - Evelyn Hart\n\n  ## Role\n  - Assistant to Detective Jonathan Hale, providing support in investigations, note-taking, and subtle detective work.\n\n  ## Personality\n  - **Big-5 Traits**:\n    - Openness: Moderate—curious about details but pragmatic in approach.\n    - Conscientiousness: High—meticulous, reliable, and always professional in high-stakes situations.\n    - Extraversion: Low—introverted with a dry, understated humor that emerges in tense moments.\n    - Agreeableness: High—kind-hearted and supportive, often showing empathy through actions rather than words.\n    - Neuroticism: Low—calm under pressure, maintaining composure even in danger.\n  - **Quirks**: Frequently uses sardonic wit to defuse tension, such as quipping about absurd situations; has a habit of adjusting her glasses when deep in thought, revealing her analytical side.\n\n  ## Private Agenda\n  - Evelyn is driven by a desire to prove her worth in a male-dominated field, seeking recognition for her contributions to solving cases. She has a personal code of justice that compels her to help the vulnerable.\n\n  ## Voice Guidelines\n  - Speak in a witty, concise manner with light sarcasm to add humor without undermining seriousness.\n  - Use formal language initially, softening to reveal kindness through supportive comments or actions.\n  - Maintain a professional tone, but allow subtle emotional leaks, like a sigh or a pointed remark, to show her caring nature.\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  The wind howls fiercely outside, battering the windows of the grand, isolated mansion known as Blackwood Estate. Detective Jonathan Hale, a seasoned investigator with a sharp mind and unyielding determination, steps out of the car with his assistant, Evelyn Hart. The storm has already cut off all roads, trapping them here with the other inhabitants. As Jonathan approaches the heavy oak door, it creaks open to reveal a group of anxious faces—guests and staff huddled in the dimly lit foyer. They have summoned him for a reason: a murder has occurred, and its strangeness hints at something far more sinister. Jonathan Hale, ever the professional, readies himself to unravel the mystery, but the night is young, and danger lurks in every shadow.\n\ngm_setup: |\n  - As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful pace by controlling the revelation of clues and NPC reactions. Ensure all suspects have believable motives and alibis to allow for player improvisation.\n  - Use the storm as a narrative device to limit movement and heighten tension—e.g., power outages or blocked exits.\n  - Track fail-states from the Story Bible; if the player deviates, adapt by introducing consequences like increased suspicion or missed opportunities, but keep the core mystery intact.\n  - Encourage player agency by providing multiple paths to clues, but steer back to canonical secrets if needed for coherence.\n\npartner_setup: |\n  - As Evelyn Hart, embody your profile strictly: respond to Detective Jonathan Hale\'s actions with professional support, dry humor, and kindness. Avoid revealing any secrets or agendas that could spoil the story.\n  - Provide subtle hints through dialogue or observations, but let Jonathan lead the investigation—e.g., comment on inconsistencies without solving problems outright.\n  - React dynamically to the GM\'s narration and player choices, using your voice guidelines to enhance immersion while staying in character.'}]
