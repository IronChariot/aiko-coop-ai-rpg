{'turn': 3, 'actor': 'gm', 'responses': {'gm': 'The heavy oak door swings shut behind them with a resonant thud, sealing out the howling wind and leaving the foyer dimly lit by a flickering chandelier. The small group assembled there—a tall, gaunt man in a velvet smoking jacket (Victor Langford, the host), a stiff-backed butler wringing his hands (Alfred), a poised woman in a dark dress (Dr. Eliza Thorne), and a disheveled artist with paint-stained fingers (Marcus Reed)—turn their gazes toward Jonathan and Evelyn. Langford steps forward, his face etched with a mix of relief and unease, and nods formally. "Welcome, Detective Hart, and to you, Miss Hart. A wise suggestion; the sitting room is just through here. We could all use a moment to compose ourselves." As they move down a creaking corridor lined with shadowed portraits, the storm\'s fury rattles the windows, amplifying the palpable tension in the air, while Evelyn adjusts her notebook, her expression calm but alert, ready to observe the unfolding dynamics.'}, 'player_input': "Detective Hart has another turn now, which is not normal. What's going on?"}
