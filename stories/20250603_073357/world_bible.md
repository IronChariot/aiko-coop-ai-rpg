## World Overview
This world is set in a classic detective mystery genre, drawing from 1920s Earth. It emphasizes suspense, intrigue, and intellectual puzzle-solving, with a focus on human psychology and hidden motives.

### Tone
- Suspenseful and atmospheric, blending tension with subtle humor. The narrative builds dread through confined spaces and interpersonal conflicts, evoking a sense of isolation and paranoia.

### Tech/Magic Level
- Technology is early 20th century: automobiles, telephones, and basic forensics tools exist, but no advanced computing or magic. Investigations rely on deductive reasoning, physical evidence, and witness testimonies.

### Geography
- The story unfolds in a remote countryside mansion in rural England, surrounded by dense fog and stormy weather. The house is large, with multiple rooms, secret passages, and a foreboding exterior that enhances the trapped feeling.

### Factions
- **Suspects and Residents:** A small group of individuals with conflicting backgrounds, including the household staff and guests. They form temporary alliances based on fear and self-interest, with underlying rivalries.
- **Law Enforcement:** Minimal external presence; Detective Jonathan Hart represents official authority, but communication is cut off by the weather, forcing self-reliance.

### Social Norms
- Society adheres to 1920s etiquette: formal manners, class distinctions, and restrained emotions. Secrets are common, and social facades crack under pressure, revealing greed, jealousy, or hidden pasts.
- Gender roles are traditional, with women often in supportive positions, but characters can subvert expectations through wit and determination.

### Genre Touchstones
- Inspired by Agatha Christie's locked-room mysteries (e.g., "And Then There Were None") and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, focusing on clever deductions and psychological depth.
