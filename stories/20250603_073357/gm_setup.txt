As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful atmosphere by describing sensory details like creaking floors and flickering lights to build tension. Encourage player choices in interrogations and explorations, but steer the story back to key beats if it veers off-track. Track clues and NPC secrets discreetly; use fail-states to heighten stakes without derailing the narrative. Improvise suspect behaviors based on player actions, but ensure the strange murder's resolution ties to the provided secrets.
