The butler, a stern man with a neatly trimmed mustache, steps forward first, his voice steady but edged with anxiety. "Of course, Detective," he replies, "I\'m Reginald Thorne, the head butler here.

Evelyn stands slightly behind her brother, her expression composed as she fiddles with her locket, offering a dry quip under her breath, "Nothing like a good introduction to cut through the storm\'s drama." They begin to herd toward a nearby sitting room, its heavy drapes drawn against the howling wind, leaving the crime scene momentarily undisturbed for Jonathan\'s inspection.'}, 'player_input': 'The detective looks at the crowd expectantly.'}
