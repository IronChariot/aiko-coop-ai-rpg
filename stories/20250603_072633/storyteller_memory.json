The tone is suspenseful and claustrophobic, emphasizing isolation, suspicion, and intellectual intrigue.\n\n  ### Tone\n  Suspenseful and tense, with a focus on psychological tension and moral ambiguity. Atmosphere builds through confined spaces and unreliable characters.\n\n  ### Tech/Magic Level\n  Modern technology level with no magic. Includes smartphones, vehicles, and basic forensics tools, but the remote setting limits access, heightening isolation.\n\n  ### Geography\n  The story takes place in a large, isolated mansion in rural New England, USA. Heavy storms frequently cut off roads and power, creating a natural trap for characters.\n\n  ### Factions\n  - **Suspects in the House**: A mix of socialites, servants, and professionals, each with hidden motives. They form temporary alliances based on fear and self-interest.\n  - **Law Enforcement**: Sparse in this rural area, represented by Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant, operating with limited backup.\n  - **Local Community**: Not directly involved, but rumors and past events influence character backstories.\n\n  ### Social Norms\n  Society values privacy and decorum, but under stress, facades crack, revealing secrets. Professionalism is key in investigations, but personal biases often interfere. Trust is scarce, and accusations can escalate quickly.\n\n  ### Genre Touchstones\n  Inspired by Agatha Christie\'s locked-room mysteries (e.g., "And Then There Were None") and modern adaptations like "Knives Out", blending classic whodunit with contemporary realism.\n\nstory_bible: |\n  ## Story Arcs Overview\n  This detective story unfolds over three arcs, focusing on investigation, revelation, and confrontation.

Tensions rise as the storm worsens, cutting off communication.\n  - **Late Beats**: A minor clue emerges, such as a hidden note or unusual object, hinting at the murder\'s strangeness. Fail-state: If Jonathan ignores key details, a suspect becomes uncooperative, delaying progress.\n  - **Key NPCs**: \n    - Victim: Wealthy host, found dead under bizarre circumstances.\n    - Suspect 1: Butler, loyal but secretive.\n    - Suspect 2: Guest, a former business rival.\n  - **Secrets**: The murder involves a concealed weapon or misdirection; the killer has a personal vendetta.\n  - **Fail-State**: Jonathan fails to secure the crime scene, allowing evidence tampering.\n\n  ### Arc 2: Uncovering Deeper Secrets\n  - **Early Beats**: Jonathan finds hidden passages or documents that reveal the victim\'s shady past, involving the suspects.\n  - **Middle Beats**: Interrogations intensify, with accusations flying and alliances shifting.

Evelyn follows, her expression calm and professional despite the downpour. They make their way to the grand entrance, where a group of anxious faces peer out from the windows. The door creaks open, revealing the mansion\'s dimly lit foyer, and the inhabitants usher them inside hastily. "Detective Hart," one of them says, voice trembling, "thank God you\'re here. There\'s been a murder, and we\'re all trapped with the killer."\n\ngm_setup: |\n  As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful atmosphere by describing sensory details like storm sounds and dim lighting to build tension.
