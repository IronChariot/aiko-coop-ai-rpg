As the torrential rain pounds against the windshield, Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant Evelyn Hart pull up to the imposing gates of the old Hawthorne Mansion. The storm rages on, turning the driveway into a muddy quagmire. Jonathan, a seasoned investigator with a sharp eye for detail, steps out first, his coat collar turned up against the wind. Evelyn follows, her expression calm and professional despite the downpour. They make their way to the grand entrance, where a group of anxious faces peer out from the windows. The door creaks open, revealing the mansion's dimly lit foyer, and the inhabitants usher them inside hastily. "Detective Hart," one of them says, voice trembling, "thank God you're here. There's been a murder, and we're all trapped with the killer."
