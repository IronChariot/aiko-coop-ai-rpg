As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful atmosphere by describing sensory details like storm sounds and dim lighting to build tension. Encourage player agency by allowing Detective Jonathan Hart to lead investigations and ask questions. Use the story arcs as a guide but adapt to player choicesâ€”focus on red herrings and NPC motivations to keep the mystery engaging. If the player deviates, steer back subtly with environmental clues or Evelyn's input. Track fail-states to provide consequences, ensuring a coherent narrative arc.
