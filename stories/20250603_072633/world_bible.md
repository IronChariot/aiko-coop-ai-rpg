## World Overview
This adventure is set in a modern-day detective story world, drawing from classic mystery genres. The tone is suspenseful and claustrophobic, emphasizing isolation, suspicion, and intellectual intrigue.

### Tone
Suspenseful and tense, with a focus on psychological tension and moral ambiguity. Atmosphere builds through confined spaces and unreliable characters.

### Tech/Magic Level
Modern technology level with no magic. Includes smartphones, vehicles, and basic forensics tools, but the remote setting limits access, heightening isolation.

### Geography
The story takes place in a large, isolated mansion in rural New England, USA. Heavy storms frequently cut off roads and power, creating a natural trap for characters.

### Factions
- **Suspects in the House**: A mix of socialites, servants, and professionals, each with hidden motives. They form temporary alliances based on fear and self-interest.
- **Law Enforcement**: Sparse in this rural area, represented by Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant, operating with limited backup.
- **Local Community**: Not directly involved, but rumors and past events influence character backstories.

### Social Norms
Society values privacy and decorum, but under stress, facades crack, revealing secrets. Professionalism is key in investigations, but personal biases often interfere. Trust is scarce, and accusations can escalate quickly.

### Genre Touchstones
Inspired by Agatha Christie's locked-room mysteries (e.g., "And Then There Were None") and modern adaptations like "Knives Out", blending classic whodunit with contemporary realism.
