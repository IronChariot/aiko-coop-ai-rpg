## World Overview
This adventure is set in a modern-day detective mystery, drawing from classic whodunit tropes with a focus on suspense, deduction, and interpersonal drama.

### Tone
- Suspenseful and atmospheric, emphasizing tension, misdirection, and psychological depth.
- Characters experience growing paranoia and distrust, balanced with moments of dark humor.

### Tech/Magic Level
- Modern technology: Smartphones, vehicles, and basic forensics tools are available, but limited by the isolated setting (e.g., poor cell service during the storm).
- No magic: All elements are grounded in realism, with the "strange" murder explained through clever twists rather than supernatural forces.

### Geography
- A remote mansion in a rural, forested region prone to severe weather, such as thunderstorms or blizzards.
- The house is large, with multiple rooms (e.g., library, kitchen, bedrooms) that serve as investigation sites, creating a claustrophobic environment.

### Factions
- Household Faction: Includes staff like a butler and maid, who are loyal to the family but may have hidden agendas.
- Guest Faction: Assorted visitors, such as family members or acquaintances, each with potential motives and secrets.
- External Faction: Law enforcement (e.g., Jonathan Hart) as outsiders, initially distrusted by the others.

### Social Norms
- Formal and polite interactions at the start, reflecting upper-class etiquette, but devolving into suspicion and conflict as the storm rages.
- Emphasis on deduction and evidence; characters value logic but are influenced by personal biases and emotions.

### Genre Touchstones
- Inspired by Agatha Christie's *And Then There Were None* and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, focusing on confined-space mysteries and intellectual puzzles.
