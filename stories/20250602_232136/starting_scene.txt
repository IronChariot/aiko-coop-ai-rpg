As the rain lashes against the windshield, Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant Evelyn Hart step out of their car and approach the imposing mansion. The storm howls around them, thunder rumbling in the distance. Jonathan, a seasoned investigator with a reputation for cracking tough cases, feels the weight of the assignment: a strange murder reported just hours ago. The door creaks open, revealing a group of anxious faces insideâ€”household staff and guests trapped by the worsening weather. "Detective Hart," a trembling voice calls from within, "thank goodness you're here. But with this storm, we're all stuck now. The murderer could be among us."
