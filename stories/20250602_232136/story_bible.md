## Story Arcs Overview
This short detective story features three interconnected arcs, building from investigation to resolution. The player character is Detective Jonathan Hart, and the narrative emphasizes clue-gathering, NPC interactions, and a surprising twist. Key NPCs include Evelyn Hart (Jonathan's assistant and sister), the victim (mansion owner), a butler, a maid, and two guests. Secrets are marked below, and fail-states involve unresolved mysteries leading to dire consequences.

### Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Discovery
- **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn arrive at the mansion during a fierce storm; they are briefed on the strange murder (e.g., victim found with an inexplicable wound). Jonathan meets key NPCs and begins initial interviews, establishing suspicions.
- **Middle Beats**: The storm traps everyone inside; Jonathan discovers the first clue (e.g., a bloody footprint), and tensions rise as accusations fly.
- **Late Beats**: A red herring emerges (e.g., a suspect with a weak alibi), setting up interpersonal conflicts. Jonathan uncovers a minor secret (e.g., an NPC's hidden affair).
- **Key NPCs**: Evelyn Hart (companion), Butler (gruff, loyal), Maid (nervous, evasive), Guest 1 (charming but secretive), Guest 2 (argumentative).
- **Secrets**: The murder weapon is hidden in an unexpected place; one NPC is covering for another.
- **Fail-States**: If Jonathan ignores early clues, an NPC becomes uncooperative, delaying progress and increasing the risk of another incident.

### Arc 2: Deepening the Mystery
- **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn search the mansion, finding contradictory evidence (e.g., a forged letter); interrogations reveal personal motives among NPCs.
- **Middle Beats**: A twist occurs (e.g., the strange murder detail is revealed as a staged suicide attempt); Jonathan faces a moral dilemma, such as accusing an innocent party.
- **Late Beats**: Clues point to the true murderer, but a confrontation leads to a chase or escape attempt within the house.
- **Key NPCs**: Same as Arc 1, with added depth (e.g., Butler has a criminal past).
- **Secrets**: The murderer is one of the guests, motivated by greed; Evelyn discovers a family heirloom tied to the crime (NPC-only knowledge).
- **Fail-States**: If Jonathan misinterprets clues, the murderer gains an ally, escalating violence or allowing an escape plan.

### Arc 3: Climax and Resolution
- **Early Beats**: Jonathan pieces together the evidence, confronting the murderer in a tense standoff.
- **Middle Beats**: A final chase or revelation exposes the strange murder's truth (e.g., it involved a rare poison).
- **Late Beats**: Resolution occurs, with Jonathan apprehending the culprit or facing consequences; the storm lifts, allowing escape or reinforcements.
- **Key NPCs**: All previous, with the murderer revealed.
- **Secrets**: The murderer framed another NPC; a post-resolution twist involves Evelyn's personal connection (kept vague for GM improvisation).
- **Fail-States**: If Jonathan fails to act decisively, the murderer escapes, leading to an open-ended or tragic ending.
