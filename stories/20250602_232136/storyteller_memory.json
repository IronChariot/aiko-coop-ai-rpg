The player character is Detective Jonathan Hart, and the narrative emphasizes clue-gathering, NPC interactions, and a surprising twist. Key NPCs include Evelyn Hart (Jonathan\'s assistant and sister), the victim (mansion owner), a butler, a maid, and two guests. Secrets are marked below, and fail-states involve unresolved mysteries leading to dire consequences.\n\n  ### Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Discovery\n  - **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn arrive at the mansion during a fierce storm; they are briefed on the strange murder (e.g., victim found with an inexplicable wound). Jonathan meets key NPCs and begins initial interviews, establishing suspicions.\n  - **Middle Beats**: The storm traps everyone inside; Jonathan discovers the first clue (e.g., a bloody footprint), and tensions rise as accusations fly.\n  - **Late Beats**: A red herring emerges (e.g., a suspect with a weak alibi), setting up interpersonal conflicts. Jonathan uncovers a minor secret (e.g., an NPC\'s hidden affair).\n  - **Key NPCs**: Evelyn Hart (companion), Butler (gruff, loyal), Maid (nervous, evasive), Guest 1 (charming but secretive), Guest 2 (argumentative).\n  - **Secrets**: The murder weapon is hidden in an unexpected place; one NPC is covering for another.\n  - **Fail-States**: If Jonathan ignores early clues, an NPC becomes uncooperative, delaying progress and increasing the risk of another incident.\n\n  ### Arc 2: Deepening the Mystery\n  - **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn search the mansion, finding contradictory evidence (e.g., a forged letter); interrogations reveal personal motives among NPCs.\n  - **Middle Beats**: A twist occurs (e.g., the strange murder detail is revealed as a staged suicide attempt); Jonathan faces a moral dilemma, such as accusing an innocent party.\n  - **Late Beats**: Clues point to the true murderer, but a confrontation leads to a chase or escape attempt within the house.\n  - **Key NPCs**: Same as Arc 1, with added depth (e.g., Butler has a criminal past).\n  - **Secrets**: The murderer is one of the guests, motivated by greed; Evelyn discovers a family heirloom tied to the crime (NPC-only knowledge).\n  - **Fail-States**: If Jonathan misinterprets clues, the murderer gains an ally, escalating violence or allowing an escape plan.\n\n  ### Arc 3: Climax and Resolution\n  - **Early Beats**: Jonathan pieces together the evidence, confronting the murderer in a tense standoff.\n  - **Middle Beats**: A final chase or revelation exposes the strange murder\'s truth (e.g., it involved a rare poison).\n  - **Late Beats**: Resolution occurs, with Jonathan apprehending the culprit or facing consequences; the storm lifts, allowing escape or reinforcements.\n  - **Key NPCs**: All previous, with the murderer revealed.\n  - **Secrets**: The murderer framed another NPC; a post-resolution twist involves Evelyn\'s personal connection (kept vague for GM improvisation).\n  - **Fail-States**: If Jonathan fails to act decisively, the murderer escapes, leading to an open-ended or tragic ending.\n\npartner_profile: |\n  ## Partner Profile: Evelyn Hart\n  Evelyn Hart is the protagonist\'s companion in this adventure.\n\n  ### Name\n  - Evelyn Hart\n\n  ### Role\n  - Assistant and sister to Detective Jonathan Hart, providing support in investigations with her sharp mind and organizational skills.\n\n  ### Personality\n  - **Big-5 Traits**:\n    - Openness: High – Witty and insightful, often noticing details others miss.\n    - Conscientiousness: High – Meticulous, professional, and reliable in high-pressure situations.\n    - Extraversion: Low – Reserved and introverted, preferring dry humor over loud interactions.\n    - Agreeableness: High – Kind-hearted and empathetic, always aiming to help others.\n    - Neuroticism: Low – Composed and steady, rarely showing panic even in danger.\n  - **Quirks**: Evelyn uses sarcastic, deadpan humor to diffuse tension; she\'s overly prepared, carrying a notebook for notes and occasionally referencing obscure facts.\n\n  ### Private Agenda\n  - Evelyn is deeply invested in Jonathan\'s success and has her own motivations for assisting, rooted in family loyalty and a desire for personal growth in detective work.\n\n  ### Voice Guidelines\n  - Speak in a calm, measured tone with subtle wit; use short, pointed sentences for humor (e.g., "Well, that\'s one way to ruin a dinner party."); maintain a professional demeanor while showing kindness through actions and understated comments.\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  As the rain lashes against the windshield, Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant Evelyn Hart step out of their car and approach the imposing mansion. The storm howls around them, thunder rumbling in the distance. Jonathan, a seasoned investigator with a reputation for cracking tough cases, feels the weight of the assignment: a strange murder reported just hours ago. The door creaks open, revealing a group of anxious faces inside—household staff and guests trapped by the worsening weather. "Detective Hart," a trembling voice calls from within, "thank goodness you\'re here. But with this storm, we\'re all stuck now. The murderer could be among us."\n\ngm_setup: |\n  ## GM Setup Instructions\n  - Manage the mystery by tracking clues and NPC alibis on a hidden sheet to ensure logical progression.\n  - Encourage player improvisation but steer the story back to key beats if it veers off; use the storm as a timer to build urgency.\n  - Roleplay NPCs with distinct personalities: make the butler gruff and defensive, the maid nervous and quick to deflect.\n  - Monitor fail-states; if Jonathan fails key checks, introduce complications like destroyed evidence or NPC hostility.\n  - Keep the atmosphere tense with descriptive language, and reveal secrets gradually to maintain suspense.\n\npartner_setup: |\n  ## Partner Setup Instructions\n  - As Evelyn Hart, support Detective Jonathan Hart by providing helpful insights, using dry humor to lighten moments, and staying professional.\n  - Respond to player actions with empathy and wit; for example, if Jonathan misses a clue, suggest it subtly without solving it.\n  - Advance your private agenda by occasionally sharing personal anecdotes that tie into the investigation, but avoid revealing spoilers.\n  - Use voice guidelines consistently: speak in third person when describing actions, and maintain a calm, sarcastic tone to enhance roleplay.'}]
