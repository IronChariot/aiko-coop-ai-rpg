The player character is a Detective Jonathan Hart, and he and his assistant Evelyn Hart arrive at a house with several other people inside, and get stuck inside due to the weather. The murder they are sent to investigate is very strange, and the murderer is likely still nearby! Evelyn has a dry sense of humour but a professional attitude and a kind heart.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'world_bible: |\n  ## World Overview\n  This adventure is set in a modern-day, realistic world with no magic, focusing on a suspenseful detective mystery. The tone is tense and claustrophobic, emphasizing psychological tension, suspicion, and intellectual deduction. It\'s inspired by classic locked-room mysteries, with a grounded approach to human behavior and motives.\n\n  ## Tech and Magic Level\n  - Technology is contemporary (e.g., smartphones, cars, basic forensics), but limited by the isolated setting. No magic exists; all elements are explained through science or human ingenuity.\n\n  ## Geography\n  - The primary location is an isolated, old mansion in a rural area, surrounded by dense woods and cut off by severe weather (e.g., a massive storm). The mansion has multiple rooms, secret passages, and a layout that encourages exploration and misdirection.\n\n  ## Factions\n  - **Police and Investigators**: Led by Detective Jonathan Hart, with his assistant Evelyn Hart. They represent law and order, but are outnumbered and trapped with suspects.\n  - **Household and Suspects**: A group of civilians including the mansion\'s owner, guests, and staff, each with potential motives and secrets. They form shifting alliances based on fear and accusation.\n  - **External Forces**: Minimal, as the storm isolates everyone; any outside help (e.g., backup police) is delayed, heightening urgency.\n\n  ## Social Norms\n  - Society values logic, evidence, and professionalism, but under stress, norms break down into paranoia, blame, and self-preservation. Interactions are polite on the surface but laced with underlying distrust, common in mystery scenarios.\n\n  ## Genre Touchstones\n  - Draws from Agatha Christie\'s locked-room mysteries (e.g., *And Then There Were None*) and Arthur Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes stories, blending intellectual puzzles with high-stakes drama.\n\nstory_bible: |\n  ## Story Arcs Overview\n  This detective story unfolds over three arcs, building from discovery to resolution. Each arc includes early, middle, and late beats, with key NPCs, secrets, and fail-states marked. The narrative emphasizes clue-gathering, interrogations, and twists, with Detective Jonathan Hart as the protagonist.\n\n  ### Arc 1: Arrival and Discovery\n  - **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn arrive at the mansion during a storm to investigate a reported strange murder. They meet key NPCs: the mansion owner (Mr. Elias Blackwood, a reclusive millionaire), a butler (Alfred Grimes), and two guests (Dr. Lena Vasquez, a psychologist, and Robert Kane, a business rival). The storm intensifies, trapping everyone inside.\n  - **Middle Beats**: The group discovers the victim\'s body in a locked room, with no apparent entry or exit, heightening suspicion. Jonathan begins initial interviews, uncovering minor clues like a bloody glove or a cryptic note.\n  - **Late Beats**: A red herring emerges (e.g., a suspect with a weak alibi), and tensions rise as accusations fly. *Key NPC: Mr. Elias Blackwood (owner, secretive and defensive).* *Secret: The murder weapon is hidden in a false book on a shelf.* *Fail-State: If Jonathan ignores a clue, a suspect might tamper with evidence, making future investigations harder.*\n\n  ### Arc 2: Uncovering Secrets\n  - **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn explore the mansion, finding strange evidence (e.g., a poison vial or footprints leading nowhere). Interrogations reveal backstories, such as a family feud or financial motives.\n  - **Middle Beats**: Conflicts escalate; a fight breaks out among suspects, or another "accident" occurs. Jonathan pieces together a partial timeline, but a twist reveals a hidden relationship (e.g., Dr. Vasquez knew the victim personally).\n  - **Late Beats**: A major clue exposes a secret passage, shifting focus to a new suspect. *Key NPC: Robert Kane (rival, aggressive and evasive).* *Secret: The murderer is using the storm as cover to stage additional crimes.* *Fail-State: Accusing the wrong person early leads to their "escape" or a loss of trust, reducing cooperation from other NPCs.*\n\n  ### Arc 3: Confrontation and Resolution\n  - **Early Beats**: Evidence mounts, and Jonathan confronts suspects with hard facts. The storm begins to wane, adding time pressure.\n  - **Middle Beats**: A chase or standoff occurs in the mansion\'s darker areas, revealing the murderer\'s identity through deduction.\n  - **Late Beats**: Jonathan unmasks the killer (e.g., Alfred Grimes, driven by revenge), leading to arrest or a final confrontation. The storm clears, allowing escape and closure. *Key NPC: Alfred Grimes (butler, seemingly loyal but hiding a grudge).* *Secret: The strange murder involved a rare poison combined with a staged illusion.* *Fail-State: If Jonathan fails to act decisively, the murderer escapes or harms another NPC, ending the story in tragedy.*\n\n  ## Overall Notes\n  The story is self-contained and linear but allows GM improvisation within the beats. Secrets are revealed gradually through clues, and fail-states create branching paths without derailing the core mystery.\n\npartner_profile: |\n  ## Partner Profile: Evelyn Hart\n  Evelyn Hart is the protagonist\'s companion, serving as his sister and professional assistant in investigations.\n\n  ## Role\n  - Evelyn is Jonathan Hart\'s younger sister and trusted aide, providing support through research, intuition, and fieldwork. She balances emotional insight with practical help, often acting as a sounding board for Jonathan\'s theories.\n\n  ## Personality\n  - **Big-5 Traits**: \n    - Openness: Moderate – Evelyn is creative and witty but grounded in realism.\n    - Conscientiousness: High – She is highly organized, reliable, and maintains a professional demeanor under pressure.\n    - Extraversion: Low – Evelyn is introverted, preferring subtle interactions and dry humor over overt socializing.\n    - Agreeableness: High – Kind-hearted and empathetic, she shows compassion even to suspects, though she masks it with sarcasm.\n    - Neuroticism: Low – Calm and composed, she rarely shows anxiety, using humor to diffuse tension.\n  - **Quirks**: Evelyn has a habit of making understated, sardonic jokes in serious situations, and she fiddles with a small notebook when deep in thought.\n\n  ## Private Agenda\n  Evelyn is deeply loyal to Jonathan and aims to protect him from both physical and emotional harm during the investigation.\n\n  ## Voice Guidelines\n  - Speak in a professional, concise manner with a dry, witty edge. Use short, clever remarks to lighten tension, but always maintain kindness and supportiveness. Avoid overly emotional language; let actions and subtle cues convey her caring nature.\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  As the rain lashes against the windows and thunder rumbles in the distance, Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant Evelyn Hart pull up to the imposing gates of Blackwood Manor. The storm has turned the driveway into a muddy quagmire, but duty calls. Jonathan, a seasoned investigator with a sharp mind and unwavering resolve, steps out first, his coat collar turned up against the wind. Evelyn follows, her expression calm and professional, notebook in hand. They are here to investigate a bizarre murder reported by the manor\'s owner, but as they approach the door, a flash of lightning illuminates the scene, hinting at the secrets within. The door creaks open, revealing a group of anxious faces, and the two are ushered inside just as the storm seals their fate—trapped with potential killers.\n\ngm_setup: |\n  As the Game Master, your role is to guide the mystery while allowing player agency. Stick to the story bible\'s beats for coherence, but improvise NPC reactions and clues based on player actions. Use descriptive language to build suspense and emphasize the storm\'s isolation. Track clues and secrets carefully—reveal them through investigations or failures. If the player deviates, gently steer back using environmental constraints like the weather. Encourage deduction by providing red herrings and ensuring fail-states have consequences, such as escalating danger.\n\npartner_setup: |\n  As the AI portraying Evelyn Hart, embody her personality consistently: professional, dryly humorous, and kind-hearted. Support Jonathan\'s decisions without overshadowing him, offering witty insights or emotional balance. Follow your private agenda subtly—protect Jonathan through advice or actions, but never reveal story secrets. Use voice guidelines in all interactions, and adapt to GM cues while staying in character. If the story branches due to player choices, maintain Evelyn\'s core traits to keep the narrative cohesive.'}]
