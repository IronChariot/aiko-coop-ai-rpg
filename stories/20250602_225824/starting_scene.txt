As the rain lashes against the windows and thunder rumbles in the distance, Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant Evelyn Hart pull up to the imposing gates of Blackwood Manor. The storm has turned the driveway into a muddy quagmire, but duty calls. Jonathan, a seasoned investigator with a sharp mind and unwavering resolve, steps out first, his coat collar turned up against the wind. Evelyn follows, her expression calm and professional, notebook in hand. They are here to investigate a bizarre murder reported by the manor's owner, but as they approach the door, a flash of lightning illuminates the scene, hinting at the secrets within. The door creaks open, revealing a group of anxious faces, and the two are ushered inside just as the storm seals their fateâ€”trapped with potential killers.
