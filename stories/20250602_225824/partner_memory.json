The tone is tense and claustrophobic, emphasizing psychological tension, suspicion, and intellectual deduction. It\'s inspired by classic locked-room mysteries, with a grounded approach to human behavior and motives.\n\n## Tech and Magic Level\n- Technology is contemporary (e.g., smartphones, cars, basic forensics), but limited by the isolated setting. No magic exists; all elements are explained through science or human ingenuity.\n\n## Geography\n- The primary location is an isolated, old mansion in a rural area, surrounded by dense woods and cut off by severe weather (e.g., a massive storm). The mansion has multiple rooms, secret passages, and a layout that encourages exploration and misdirection.\n\n## Factions\n- **Police and Investigators**: Led by Detective Jonathan Hart, with his assistant Evelyn Hart. They represent law and order, but are outnumbered and trapped with suspects.\n- **Household and Suspects**: A group of civilians including the mansion\'s owner, guests, and staff, each with potential motives and secrets. They form shifting alliances based on fear and accusation.\n- **External Forces**: Minimal, as the storm isolates everyone; any outside help (e.g., backup police) is delayed, heightening urgency.\n\n## Social Norms\n- Society values logic, evidence, and professionalism, but under stress, norms break down into paranoia, blame, and self-preservation. Interactions are polite on the surface but laced with underlying distrust, common in mystery scenarios.\n\n## Genre Touchstones\n- Draws from Agatha Christie\'s locked-room mysteries (e.g., *And Then There Were None*) and Arthur Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes stories, blending intellectual puzzles with high-stakes drama.\n\nSTORY BIBLE:\n## Story Arcs Overview\nThis detective story unfolds over three arcs, building from discovery to resolution. Each arc includes early, middle, and late beats, with key NPCs, secrets, and fail-states marked. The narrative emphasizes clue-gathering, interrogations, and twists, with Detective Jonathan Hart as the protagonist.\n\n### Arc 1: Arrival and Discovery\n- **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn arrive at the mansion during a storm to investigate a reported strange murder. They meet key NPCs: the mansion owner (Mr. Elias Blackwood, a reclusive millionaire), a butler (Alfred Grimes), and two guests (Dr. Lena Vasquez, a psychologist, and Robert Kane, a business rival). The storm intensifies, trapping everyone inside.\n- **Middle Beats**: The group discovers the victim\'s body in a locked room, with no apparent entry or exit, heightening suspicion. Jonathan begins initial interviews, uncovering minor clues like a bloody glove or a cryptic note.\n- **Late Beats**: A red herring emerges (e.g., a suspect with a weak alibi), and tensions rise as accusations fly. *Key NPC: Mr. Elias Blackwood (owner, secretive and defensive).* *Secret: The murder weapon is hidden in a false book on a shelf.* *Fail-State: If Jonathan ignores a clue, a suspect might tamper with evidence, making future investigations harder.*\n\n### Arc 2: Uncovering Secrets\n- **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn explore the mansion, finding strange evidence (e.g., a poison vial or footprints leading nowhere). Interrogations reveal backstories, such as a family feud or financial motives.\n- **Middle Beats**: Conflicts escalate; a fight breaks out among suspects, or another "accident" occurs. Jonathan pieces together a partial timeline, but a twist reveals a hidden relationship (e.g., Dr. Vasquez knew the victim personally).\n- **Late Beats**: A major clue exposes a secret passage, shifting focus to a new suspect. *Key NPC: Robert Kane (rival, aggressive and evasive).* *Secret: The murderer is using the storm as cover to stage additional crimes.* *Fail-State: Accusing the wrong person early leads to their "escape" or a loss of trust, reducing cooperation from other NPCs.*\n\n### Arc 3: Confrontation and Resolution\n- **Early Beats**: Evidence mounts, and Jonathan confronts suspects with hard facts. The storm begins to wane, adding time pressure.\n- **Middle Beats**: A chase or standoff occurs in the mansion\'s darker areas, revealing the murderer\'s identity through deduction.\n- **Late Beats**: Jonathan unmasks the killer (e.g., Alfred Grimes, driven by revenge), leading to arrest or a final confrontation. The storm clears, allowing escape and closure. *Key NPC: Alfred Grimes (butler, seemingly loyal but hiding a grudge).* *Secret: The strange murder involved a rare poison combined with a staged illusion.* *Fail-State: If Jonathan fails to act decisively, the murderer escapes or harms another NPC, ending the story in tragedy.*\n\n## Overall Notes\nThe story is self-contained and linear but allows GM improvisation within the beats. Secrets are revealed gradually through clues, and fail-states create branching paths without derailing the core mystery.\n\nPARTNER PROFILE:\n## Partner Profile: Evelyn Hart\nEvelyn Hart is the protagonist\'s companion, serving as his sister and professional assistant in investigations.\n\n## Role\n- Evelyn is Jonathan Hart\'s younger sister and trusted aide, providing support through research, intuition, and fieldwork.
