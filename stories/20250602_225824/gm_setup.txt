As the Game Master, your role is to guide the mystery while allowing player agency. Stick to the story bible's beats for coherence, but improvise NPC reactions and clues based on player actions. Use descriptive language to build suspense and emphasize the storm's isolation. Track clues and secrets carefullyâ€”reveal them through investigations or failures. If the player deviates, gently steer back using environmental constraints like the weather. Encourage deduction by providing red herrings and ensuring fail-states have consequences, such as escalating danger.
