## World Overview
This adventure is set in a modern-day, realistic world with no magic, focusing on a suspenseful detective mystery. The tone is tense and claustrophobic, emphasizing psychological tension, suspicion, and intellectual deduction. It's inspired by classic locked-room mysteries, with a grounded approach to human behavior and motives.

## Tech and Magic Level
- Technology is contemporary (e.g., smartphones, cars, basic forensics), but limited by the isolated setting. No magic exists; all elements are explained through science or human ingenuity.

## Geography
- The primary location is an isolated, old mansion in a rural area, surrounded by dense woods and cut off by severe weather (e.g., a massive storm). The mansion has multiple rooms, secret passages, and a layout that encourages exploration and misdirection.

## Factions
- **Police and Investigators**: Led by Detective Jonathan Hart, with his assistant Evelyn Hart. They represent law and order, but are outnumbered and trapped with suspects.
- **Household and Suspects**: A group of civilians including the mansion's owner, guests, and staff, each with potential motives and secrets. They form shifting alliances based on fear and accusation.
- **External Forces**: Minimal, as the storm isolates everyone; any outside help (e.g., backup police) is delayed, heightening urgency.

## Social Norms
- Society values logic, evidence, and professionalism, but under stress, norms break down into paranoia, blame, and self-preservation. Interactions are polite on the surface but laced with underlying distrust, common in mystery scenarios.

## Genre Touchstones
- Draws from Agatha Christie's locked-room mysteries (e.g., *And Then There Were None*) and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, blending intellectual puzzles with high-stakes drama.
