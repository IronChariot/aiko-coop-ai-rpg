## Story Arcs Overview
This detective story unfolds over three arcs, building from discovery to resolution. Each arc includes early, middle, and late beats, with key NPCs, secrets, and fail-states marked. The narrative emphasizes clue-gathering, interrogations, and twists, with Detective Jonathan Hart as the protagonist.

### Arc 1: Arrival and Discovery
- **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn arrive at the mansion during a storm to investigate a reported strange murder. They meet key NPCs: the mansion owner (Mr. Elias Blackwood, a reclusive millionaire), a butler (Alfred Grimes), and two guests (Dr. Lena Vasquez, a psychologist, and Robert Kane, a business rival). The storm intensifies, trapping everyone inside.
- **Middle Beats**: The group discovers the victim's body in a locked room, with no apparent entry or exit, heightening suspicion. Jonathan begins initial interviews, uncovering minor clues like a bloody glove or a cryptic note.
- **Late Beats**: A red herring emerges (e.g., a suspect with a weak alibi), and tensions rise as accusations fly. *Key NPC: Mr. Elias Blackwood (owner, secretive and defensive).* *Secret: The murder weapon is hidden in a false book on a shelf.* *Fail-State: If Jonathan ignores a clue, a suspect might tamper with evidence, making future investigations harder.*

### Arc 2: Uncovering Secrets
- **Early Beats**: Jonathan and Evelyn explore the mansion, finding strange evidence (e.g., a poison vial or footprints leading nowhere). Interrogations reveal backstories, such as a family feud or financial motives.
- **Middle Beats**: Conflicts escalate; a fight breaks out among suspects, or another "accident" occurs. Jonathan pieces together a partial timeline, but a twist reveals a hidden relationship (e.g., Dr. Vasquez knew the victim personally).
- **Late Beats**: A major clue exposes a secret passage, shifting focus to a new suspect. *Key NPC: Robert Kane (rival, aggressive and evasive).* *Secret: The murderer is using the storm as cover to stage additional crimes.* *Fail-State: Accusing the wrong person early leads to their "escape" or a loss of trust, reducing cooperation from other NPCs.*

### Arc 3: Confrontation and Resolution
- **Early Beats**: Evidence mounts, and Jonathan confronts suspects with hard facts. The storm begins to wane, adding time pressure.
- **Middle Beats**: A chase or standoff occurs in the mansion's darker areas, revealing the murderer's identity through deduction.
- **Late Beats**: Jonathan unmasks the killer (e.g., Alfred Grimes, driven by revenge), leading to arrest or a final confrontation. The storm clears, allowing escape and closure. *Key NPC: Alfred Grimes (butler, seemingly loyal but hiding a grudge).* *Secret: The strange murder involved a rare poison combined with a staged illusion.* *Fail-State: If Jonathan fails to act decisively, the murderer escapes or harms another NPC, ending the story in tragedy.*

## Overall Notes
The story is self-contained and linear but allows GM improvisation within the beats. Secrets are revealed gradually through clues, and fail-states create branching paths without derailing the core mystery.
