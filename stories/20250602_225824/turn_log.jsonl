The foyer of Blackwood Manor is dimly lit by flickering wall sconces, their warm glow casting long shadows that dance across the ornate wallpaper and antique furniture. Rain drums incessantly against the stained-glass windows, and the air is thick with the scent of aged wood and damp wool. A small group of people stands clustered near a grand staircase, their faces etched with a mix of fear and curiosity. Mr. Elias Blackwood, a tall man with a gaunt face and piercing eyes, clutches a silver-topped cane. Beside him, Alfred Grimes, the butler, wears a stoic expression, his uniform immaculate despite the chaos. Dr. Lena Vasquez, a composed woman in her forties with sharp features and a medical bag slung over her shoulder, fidgets slightly. And Robert Kane, broad-shouldered and imposing, crosses his arms, his jaw set in a hard line.\n\nAs you, Detective Jonathan Hart, remove your hat and introduce yourself and Evelyn, the group falls silent for a beat. Blackwood steps forward, his voice steady but edged with irritation. "Detective Hart, Miss Hart—welcome, though I wish it were under better circumstances. I\'m Elias Blackwood, the owner of this... unfortunate estate. And yes, a sitting room might be prudent. The storm has us all on edge, and I\'m sure you need a moment to gather your thoughts before delving into this mess."\n\nAlfred Grimes nods curtly, his tone professional and clipped. "Of course, sir. Right this way. The drawing room is just down the hall—it\'s the most comfortable space we have. I\'ll ensure everyone is settled." He gestures for the group to follow, but Dr. Vasquez lingers a moment, her eyes meeting yours with a hint of appraisal. "If you need any psychological insights into the group\'s state, Detective, I\'m at your disposal," she offers quietly, her voice calm and measured.\n\nEvelyn, standing beside you, flips open her notebook with a faint rustle, her expression unchanging as she scans the room. "How thoughtful," she murmurs dryly, her voice low enough for only you to hear. "A sitting room for the suspects—almost civilized. Let\'s hope they don\'t start comparing alibis over tea."\n\nGrimes leads the way, and the group begins to move, their footsteps echoing on the marble floor. As you follow, the storm outside seems to intensify, a flash of lightning illuminating the hallway and casting eerie shadows. You have a moment to decide how to proceed—whether to escort the group to the sitting room first or perhaps request to see the crime scene immediately. What would you like to do next?'}, 'player_input': None}
