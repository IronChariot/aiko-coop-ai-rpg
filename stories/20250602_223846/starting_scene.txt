The wind howls fiercely outside as your car crawls up the long, snow-laden driveway to the isolated Hawthorne Mansion. Flurries of snow obscure your vision, but the grand, gothic structure looms ahead, its windows flickering with warm light. As you and your assistant, Elara Finch, step out into the biting cold, the mansion's heavy oak door creaks open. A stern-faced butler ushers you inside, his expression grave. "Detective, you're just in time. The storm's worsening, and... well, there's been a murder. The victim was found in the libraryâ€”it's most peculiar. No one could have entered or left the room, yet there they lie. The others are gathered in the drawing room, waiting. Be careful; we're all trapped here now."
