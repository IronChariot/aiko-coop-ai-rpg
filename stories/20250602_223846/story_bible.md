## Story Arcs Overview
This short detective story is structured into three arcs, building from setup to resolution. The narrative focuses on a strange murder in a confined space, with the murderer among the trapped individuals. Key elements include clue discovery, suspect interrogations, and a climactic reveal. Fail-states allow for branching paths but maintain coherence.

## Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Investigation
- **Early Beats**:
  - Detective and assistant arrive at the mansion amid a blizzard; they are greeted by the host and introduced to other guests and staff.
  - Initial examination of the crime scene reveals the victim's body and bizarre details, such as an impossible entry/exit point.
  - Suspects are interviewed superficially, establishing alibis and motives; tension rises as the storm worsens, trapping everyone inside.
- **Key NPCs**:
  - Host: Wealthy recluse with a secretive past.
  - Suspects: Includes a family member with inheritance motives, a disgruntled servant, and a mysterious guest.
  - Assistant: Elara Finch, the detective's apprentice.
- **Secrets**: The murder involves a clever trick (e.g., a hidden mechanism), and the victim had a hidden enemy among the group.
- **Fail-States**: If the detective ignores initial clues, a secondary event (e.g., tampering with evidence) occurs, complicating the investigation.

## Arc 2: Deepening Mystery
- **Middle Beats**:
  - Deeper interrogations uncover lies and red herrings; clues like forged documents or overheard arguments emerge.
  - A twist reveals a personal connection between the detective/assistant and a suspect, raising stakes.
  - The group dynamics fracture, leading to conflicts or another incident (e.g., a false alarm or minor injury).
- **Key NPCs**: Additional details on suspects, such as the servant's hidden grudge or the guest's dubious background.
- **Secrets**: One suspect is protecting another, and the strange murder method involves misdirection (e.g., a staged suicide).
- **Fail-States**: Misinterpreting clues leads to accusing the wrong person, resulting in loss of trust and potential violence.

## Arc 3: Climax and Resolution
- **Late Beats**:
  - The detective pieces together the evidence, confronting the murderer in a tense standoff.
  - Revelation of the full truth, including motives and the strange method (e.g., a secret passage used).
  - Resolution involves apprehending the culprit or, in failure, their escape during the storm's chaos.
- **Key NPCs**: Murderer is revealed as one of the core suspects; assistant plays a pivotal role in the confrontation.
- **Secrets**: The murderer had a personal vendetta, tied to a family secret; fail-state involves the murderer turning the tables on the detective.
- **Fail-States**: If critical clues are missed, the murderer escapes, or the detective is harmed, ending the story on a darker note.
