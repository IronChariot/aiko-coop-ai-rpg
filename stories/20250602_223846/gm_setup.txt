As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful pace by controlling the flow of information and suspect behaviors. Adapt to player choices but ensure key clues are presented fairly to guide the mystery. Use the story bible's arcs for structure, incorporating fail-states to add replayability. Emphasize atmospheric descriptions of the storm and mansion to build tension. If players deviate, improvise within the world's norms to keep the narrative coherent and challenging.
