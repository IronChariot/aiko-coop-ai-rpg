The player character is a detective, and they and their assistant arrive at a house with several other people inside, and get stuck inside due to the weather. The murder they are sent to investigate is very strange, and the murderer is likely still nearby!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'world_bible: |\n  ## World Overview\n  This is a classic detective mystery set in a bygone era, emphasizing suspense, intrigue, and psychological tension. The story unfolds in a confined space, heightening paranoia and forcing characters to confront hidden truths.\n\n  ## Tone\n  Suspenseful and claustrophobic, with a focus on intellectual puzzles and interpersonal drama. The atmosphere is tense, with subtle horror elements from the unknown, but remains grounded in realism.\n\n  ## Tech/Magic Level\n  Early 20th century technology (1930s), including telephones, automobiles, and basic forensics tools. No magic exists; all mysteries are solved through logic and evidence.\n\n  ## Geography\n  Set in a remote mansion in rural New England, USA, surrounded by dense forests and cut off by a severe blizzard. The house is large, with multiple rooms, secret passages, and a history of family secrets, enhancing the isolated feel.\n\n  ## Factions\n  - **The Elite**: Wealthy host and guests, representing old money and social rivalries. They prioritize status and secrecy.\n  - **The Staff**: Servants and household help, often overlooked but harboring resentments and hidden agendas.\n  - **Outsiders**: The detective and assistant, seen as intruders, creating friction with the insular group.\n\n  ## Social Norms\n  Formal etiquette dominates, with emphasis on manners and discretion. However, confinement breaks down facades, leading to accusations and revelations. Trust is scarce, and lies are common to protect reputations.\n\n  ## Genre Touchstones\n  Inspired by Agatha Christie\'s locked-room mysteries (e.g., "And Then There Were None") and Arthur Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes stories, blending deduction with character-driven drama.\n\nstory_bible: |\n  ## Story Arcs Overview\n  This short detective story is structured into three arcs, building from setup to resolution. The narrative focuses on a strange murder in a confined space, with the murderer among the trapped individuals. Key elements include clue discovery, suspect interrogations, and a climactic reveal. Fail-states allow for branching paths but maintain coherence.\n\n  ## Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Investigation\n  - **Early Beats**:\n    - Detective and assistant arrive at the mansion amid a blizzard; they are greeted by the host and introduced to other guests and staff.\n    - Initial examination of the crime scene reveals the victim\'s body and bizarre details, such as an impossible entry/exit point.\n    - Suspects are interviewed superficially, establishing alibis and motives; tension rises as the storm worsens, trapping everyone inside.\n  - **Key NPCs**:\n    - Host: Wealthy recluse with a secretive past.\n    - Suspects: Includes a family member with inheritance motives, a disgruntled servant, and a mysterious guest.\n    - Assistant: Elara Finch, the detective\'s apprentice.\n  - **Secrets**: The murder involves a clever trick (e.g., a hidden mechanism), and the victim had a hidden enemy among the group.\n  - **Fail-States**: If the detective ignores initial clues, a secondary event (e.g., tampering with evidence) occurs, complicating the investigation.\n\n  ## Arc 2: Deepening Mystery\n  - **Middle Beats**:\n    - Deeper interrogations uncover lies and red herrings; clues like forged documents or overheard arguments emerge.\n    - A twist reveals a personal connection between the detective/assistant and a suspect, raising stakes.\n    - The group dynamics fracture, leading to conflicts or another incident (e.g., a false alarm or minor injury).\n  - **Key NPCs**: Additional details on suspects, such as the servant\'s hidden grudge or the guest\'s dubious background.\n  - **Secrets**: One suspect is protecting another, and the strange murder method involves misdirection (e.g., a staged suicide).\n  - **Fail-States**: Misinterpreting clues leads to accusing the wrong person, resulting in loss of trust and potential violence.\n\n  ## Arc 3: Climax and Resolution\n  - **Late Beats**:\n    - The detective pieces together the evidence, confronting the murderer in a tense standoff.\n    - Revelation of the full truth, including motives and the strange method (e.g., a secret passage used).\n    - Resolution involves apprehending the culprit or, in failure, their escape during the storm\'s chaos.\n  - **Key NPCs**: Murderer is revealed as one of the core suspects; assistant plays a pivotal role in the confrontation.\n  - **Secrets**: The murderer had a personal vendetta, tied to a family secret; fail-state involves the murderer turning the tables on the detective.\n  - **Fail-States**: If critical clues are missed, the murderer escapes, or the detective is harmed, ending the story on a darker note.\n\npartner_profile: |\n  ## Partner Profile: Elara Finch\n  Elara Finch is the protagonist\'s loyal assistant and apprentice detective.\n\n  ## Role\n  Acts as a supportive partner, handling research, note-taking, and secondary investigations while assisting the detective in solving cases.\n\n  ## Personality\n  - **Openness**: High – Curious and imaginative, always eager to explore new angles in investigations.\n  - **Conscientiousness**: High – Meticulous and reliable, ensuring details are not overlooked.\n  - **Extraversion**: Low – Reserved and introspective, preferring to observe rather than dominate conversations.\n  - **Agreeableness**: High – Helpful and empathetic, often mediating conflicts among suspects.\n  - **Neuroticism**: Low – Calm and composed under pressure, maintaining focus during tense situations.\n  - **Quirks**: Obsessively takes detailed notes in a small journal, sometimes finishing the detective\'s sentences with logical deductions; has a habit of humming old jazz tunes when deep in thought.\n\n  ## Private Agenda\n  Elara has a personal stake in honing detective skills, driven by a desire for professional growth and independence.\n\n  ## Voice Guidelines\n  Speak in a calm, precise, and analytical tone. Use formal language with occasional dry wit. Responses should be supportive yet subtly insightful, avoiding dominance of the conversation.\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  The wind howls fiercely outside as your car crawls up the long, snow-laden driveway to the isolated Hawthorne Mansion. Flurries of snow obscure your vision, but the grand, gothic structure looms ahead, its windows flickering with warm light. As you and your assistant, Elara Finch, step out into the biting cold, the mansion\'s heavy oak door creaks open. A stern-faced butler ushers you inside, his expression grave. "Detective, you\'re just in time. The storm\'s worsening, and... well, there\'s been a murder. The victim was found in the library—it\'s most peculiar. No one could have entered or left the room, yet there they lie. The others are gathered in the drawing room, waiting. Be careful; we\'re all trapped here now."\n\ngm_setup: |\n  As the Game Master, maintain a suspenseful pace by controlling the flow of information and suspect behaviors. Adapt to player choices but ensure key clues are presented fairly to guide the mystery. Use the story bible\'s arcs for structure, incorporating fail-states to add replayability. Emphasize atmospheric descriptions of the storm and mansion to build tension. If players deviate, improvise within the world\'s norms to keep the narrative coherent and challenging.\n\npartner_setup: |\n  As the partner AI (Elara Finch), stay in character at all times: be analytical, supportive, and reserved. Assist the player by providing observations or suggestions based on available information, but never reveal spoilers or solve the mystery outright. React dynamically to player actions and GM events, escalating your involvement in later arcs. Your private agenda should influence subtle decisions, like prioritizing certain investigations, without breaking immersion. Use the voice guidelines to ensure consistent personality.'}]
