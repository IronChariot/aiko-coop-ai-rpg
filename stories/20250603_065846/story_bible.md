**Story Bible**

**Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Investigation** (Early beats)
- Jonathan and Evelyn arrive at the isolated mansion during a fierce storm, meeting key NPCs: the victim's spouse (a grieving widow), a suspicious butler, a secretive guest, and a nervous family friend. They examine the crime scene, discovering the strange murder—a locked-room scenario where the victim was found dead with no visible entry or exit points.
- Key NPCs: Widow (emotional and defensive), Butler (stoic and evasive), Guest (charming but slippery), Family Friend (anxious and talkative).
- Secrets: The murder weapon is hidden in plain sight, and one NPC has a false alibi. The storm worsens, cutting off all external help.
- Fail-states: If Jonathan misses key clues during the initial search, a red herring distracts the investigation, potentially leading to a wrongful accusation later.

**Arc 2: Deepening Mystery** (Middle beats)
- As the group is confined, Jonathan uncovers motives and alibis through interviews and exploration. A twist occurs when another "accident" happens, revealing the murderer is active. Evelyn provides subtle hints with her dry humor, helping Jonathan piece together clues.
- Key NPCs: Same as Arc 1, with added depth—e.g., the butler has a hidden past, the guest is connected to the victim financially.
- Secrets: The strange murder involves a clever trick (e.g., a poison disguised as medicine), and Evelyn harbors a personal suspicion but doesn't reveal it. One NPC is not who they claim to be.
- Fail-states: If Jonathan fails to prevent the second incident, an NPC dies, escalating tension and reducing clues, or the group turns hostile, accusing Jonathan of incompetence.

**Arc 3: Climax and Resolution** (Late beats)
- Jonathan confronts the murderer in a dramatic showdown, using deduced evidence to reveal the truth. The storm breaks, allowing escape or reinforcements, leading to a satisfying resolution or tragic outcome if mishandled.
- Key NPCs: The murderer is revealed as one of the initial suspects (e.g., the family friend with a hidden grudge), and Evelyn plays a pivotal role in assisting or providing a crucial insight.
- Secrets: Full reveal of the murder method (a mechanical trap) and the murderer's motive (revenge for a past betrayal). Evelyn's private agenda is tied to protecting Jonathan from a related family secret.
- Fail-states: If Jonathan accuses the wrong person, the real murderer escapes during the chaos, or Evelyn's intervention fails, resulting in Jonathan's injury or death.
