As the Game Master, manage the mystery by tracking hidden clues and NPC secrets without revealing them prematurely. Use the story arcs as a guide but allow improvisation based on player actionsâ€”e.g., if Jonathan focuses on a specific NPC, introduce related red herrings. Monitor fail-states to create tension, and ensure Evelyn's AI partner adheres to her profile for consistency. Keep the pace escalating, with environmental factors like the storm influencing events.
