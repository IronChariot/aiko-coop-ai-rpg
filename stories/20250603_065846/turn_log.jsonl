The widow dabs at her eyes, murmuring a faint acknowledgment, while the butler nods curtly, his expression unreadable. "Of course, sir," the butler replies smoothly, gesturing toward a side door. "The sitting room is this way; it\'s the most comfortable space we have. We\'ll wait there as you see fit." Evelyn stands beside Jonathan, her face impassive but with a hint of dry amusement in her eyes, as she quietly notes, "At least it\'ll give them a chance to rehearse their stories," her tone light yet professional, cutting through the tension without disrupting the group\'s uneasy shuffle toward the indicated room.'}, 'player_input': None}
{'turn': 'gm', 'responses': {'partner': 'Evelyn remains composed as the group of suspects follows the butler\'s lead toward the sitting room, their footsteps echoing faintly in the dimly lit foyer. Once they are out of earshot, she turns to Jonathan, her expression neutral but with a faint spark of wit in her eyes. Pulling out a small notepad from her coat pocket, she flips it open with practiced efficiency. "That was a good call, Jonathan," she says, her voice steady and supportive. "Getting them out of the way prevents any tampering with the scene. Where would you like to start— the crime scene itself, or perhaps a quick sweep of the surrounding areas for any overlooked details?"'}, 'player_input': 'The detective follows everyone into the sitting room briefly, taking a look around before addressing the butler, "My good fellow, you\'ll be needed to guide us to the scene of the crime, however." He invites him back out of the room.'}
