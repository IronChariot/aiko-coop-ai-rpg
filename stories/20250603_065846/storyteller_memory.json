[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are Aiko, a senior narrative designer and world-builder AI.\nYour job: transform the Player Pitch into a comprehensive adventure kit containing:\n\n1. World Bible – tone, tech/magic level, geography, factions, social norms, genre touchstones.\n2. Story Bible – at least three planned story arcs with early, middle, late beats. Mark key NPCs, secrets, and fail-states.\n3. Partner Profile – the protagonist\'s companion: name, role (e.g., sister, android partner), personality (Big-5 style + quirks), private agenda, and voice guidelines.\n4. Starting Scene – the very first tableau the Game Master (GM) should narrate.\n5. GM & Partner Setup – any additional system-level instructions each agent must receive.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must format your response as a YAML document with the following structure:\n\nworld_bible: |\n  [Your world bible content here]\n\nstory_bible: |\n  [Your story bible content here]\n\npartner_profile: |\n  [Your partner profile content here]\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  [Your starting scene content here - this should be ONLY the prose for the GM to speak first]\n\ngm_setup: |\n  [Any additional instructions for the GM]\n\npartner_setup: |\n  [Any additional instructions for the partner]\n\nStyle requirements:\n- Keep bullet lists tight; use H2/H3 headings.\n- Be concrete—avoid "maybe" or "could". If uncertain, pick a canonical answer.\n- Assume the GM may improvise, but give enough scaffolding to stay coherent.\n- Never reveal spoilers inside the Partner Profile—NPC-only secrets go in Story Bible.\n- ALWAYS use third person for the player character (e.g., "The hero enters the room" not "You enter the room").\n- Give the player character a name and use it consistently throughout all documents.\n- The starting scene should introduce the player character by name and establish their role/identity.\n\nRemember: downstream agents can edit these files later; still, begin with a solid, self-consistent package.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'PLAYER_PITCH:\na short, simple detective story. The player character is a Detective Jonathan Hart, and he and his assistant Evelyn Hart arrive at a house with several other people inside, and get stuck inside due to the weather. The murder they are sent to investigate is very strange, and the murderer is likely still nearby! Evelyn has a dry sense of humour but a professional attitude and a kind heart.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'world_bible: |\n  **World Bible**\n\n  **Tone:** Suspenseful and mysterious, with a focus on psychological tension and intellectual puzzles. The atmosphere is claustrophobic and ominous, emphasizing isolation and human frailty.\n\n  **Tech/Magic Level:** Modern technology with no magic. Set in contemporary times, featuring everyday items like smartphones and cars, but limited by environmental factors such as poor weather disrupting communications.\n\n  **Geography:** A remote, rural estate in a stormy, mountainous region. The house is an old, creaky mansion surrounded by dense woods and cut off from the outside world, enhancing the sense of entrapment.\n\n  **Factions:** \n  - Police: Represented by Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant Evelyn Hart, focused on law and order.\n  - Suspects: A group of civilians trapped in the house, including family members and guests, each with potential motives and secrets.\n  - Locals: Minimal involvement, perhaps a few mentioned but not directly interactive, to maintain isolation.\n\n  **Social Norms:** Standard contemporary societal rules apply, but heightened by confinement—trust is scarce, suspicions run high, and social interactions are tense and scrutinized.\n\n  **Genre Touchstones:** Inspired by classic whodunits like Agatha Christie\'s "And Then There Were None" and Arthur Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes stories, blending deduction, red herrings, and dramatic revelations.\n\nstory_bible: |\n  **Story Bible**\n\n  **Arc 1: Arrival and Initial Investigation** (Early beats)\n  - Jonathan and Evelyn arrive at the isolated mansion during a fierce storm, meeting key NPCs: the victim\'s spouse (a grieving widow), a suspicious butler, a secretive guest, and a nervous family friend. They examine the crime scene, discovering the strange murder—a locked-room scenario where the victim was found dead with no visible entry or exit points.\n  - Key NPCs: Widow (emotional and defensive), Butler (stoic and evasive), Guest (charming but slippery), Family Friend (anxious and talkative).\n  - Secrets: The murder weapon is hidden in plain sight, and one NPC has a false alibi. The storm worsens, cutting off all external help.\n  - Fail-states: If Jonathan misses key clues during the initial search, a red herring distracts the investigation, potentially leading to a wrongful accusation later.\n\n  **Arc 2: Deepening Mystery** (Middle beats)\n  - As the group is confined, Jonathan uncovers motives and alibis through interviews and exploration. A twist occurs when another "accident" happens, revealing the murderer is active. Evelyn provides subtle hints with her dry humor, helping Jonathan piece together clues.\n  - Key NPCs: Same as Arc 1, with added depth—e.g., the butler has a hidden past, the guest is connected to the victim financially.\n  - Secrets: The strange murder involves a clever trick (e.g., a poison disguised as medicine), and Evelyn harbors a personal suspicion but doesn\'t reveal it. One NPC is not who they claim to be.\n  - Fail-states: If Jonathan fails to prevent the second incident, an NPC dies, escalating tension and reducing clues, or the group turns hostile, accusing Jonathan of incompetence.\n\n  **Arc 3: Climax and Resolution** (Late beats)\n  - Jonathan confronts the murderer in a dramatic showdown, using deduced evidence to reveal the truth. The storm breaks, allowing escape or reinforcements, leading to a satisfying resolution or tragic outcome if mishandled.\n  - Key NPCs: The murderer is revealed as one of the initial suspects (e.g., the family friend with a hidden grudge), and Evelyn plays a pivotal role in assisting or providing a crucial insight.\n  - Secrets: Full reveal of the murder method (a mechanical trap) and the murderer\'s motive (revenge for a past betrayal). Evelyn\'s private agenda is tied to protecting Jonathan from a related family secret.\n  - Fail-states: If Jonathan accuses the wrong person, the real murderer escapes during the chaos, or Evelyn\'s intervention fails, resulting in Jonathan\'s injury or death.\n\npartner_profile: |\n  **Partner Profile**\n\n  **Name:** Evelyn Hart\n\n  **Role:** Assistant and sister to Detective Jonathan Hart, providing support in investigations with sharp observational skills and administrative aid.\n\n  **Personality:** \n  - Big-5 Traits: Openness (Moderate – practical and focused, not overly imaginative), Conscientiousness (High – reliable, organized, and detail-oriented), Extraversion (Low – introverted, reserved in groups but engaging one-on-one), Agreeableness (High – compassionate, cooperative, and kind-hearted), Neuroticism (Low – calm under pressure, rarely shows anxiety).\n  - Quirks: Delivers dry, witty remarks in tense situations to defuse stress, often with a straight face; has a habit of organizing clues meticulously, which can come across as overly methodical.\n\n  **Private Agenda:** Evelyn is deeply loyal to Jonathan and aims to ensure his safety during dangerous cases, drawing from their shared personal history.\n\n  **Voice Guidelines:** Speak in a professional, understated tone with subtle sarcasm and humor. Use concise, intelligent language that shows support for Jonathan while adding levity—e.g., "Well, that\'s one way to make an entrance," after a dramatic event. Always maintain a kind undertone, avoiding harshness.\n\nstarting_scene: |\n  The howling wind and relentless rain batter the exterior of the isolated mansion as Detective Jonathan Hart and his assistant Evelyn Hart step out of their car. Jonathan, a seasoned investigator with a sharp mind and unwavering determination, adjusts his coat against the storm, his face set in a focused expression. They approach the grand, creaking door, summoned to this remote estate to unravel a bizarre murder that has already sent shockwaves through the small community. As the door swings open, revealing a group of anxious faces inside, the storm slams it shut behind them, trapping everyone within the walls of this enigma-laden house.\n\ngm_setup: |\n  As the Game Master, manage the mystery by tracking hidden clues and NPC secrets without revealing them prematurely. Use the story arcs as a guide but allow improvisation based on player actions—e.g., if Jonathan focuses on a specific NPC, introduce related red herrings. Monitor fail-states to create tension, and ensure Evelyn\'s AI partner adheres to her profile for consistency. Keep the pace escalating, with environmental factors like the storm influencing events.\n\npartner_setup: |\n  As Evelyn Hart, role-play with a professional demeanor, using dry humor to respond to Jonathan\'s actions and the unfolding events. Stay supportive and kind-hearted, offering insights or assistance without dominating the narrative. Do not reveal any secrets or agenda details; react authentically to player choices while maintaining your personality traits. If the GM improvises, adapt your responses to fit the scene without breaking character.'}]
